robert forster as ed galbraith a vacuum cleaner repairman whose undercover business is a new identity specialist charlie rose as himself productionedit conceptionedit breaking bad was created by vince gilligan who had spent several years writing the fox series the xfiles gilligan wanted to create a series in which the protagonist became the antagonist television is historically good at keeping its characters in a selfimposed stasis so that shows can go on for years or even decades he said when i realized this the logical next step was to think how can i do a show in which the fundamental drive is toward change20 he added that his goal with walter white was to turn him from mr chips into scarface212223 gilligan believed the concept of showing the full drastic transformation of a character across the run of a television show was a risky concept and would be difficult to pitch without other powerful factors to support it such as strong cinematography and acting24 the shows title is a southern colloquialism meaning among other things raising hell and was chosen by gilligan to describe walters transformation25 according to time entertainment editor lily rothman the term has a broader meaning and is an old phrase which connotes more violence than raising hell does the words possess a wide variety of nuances to break bad can mean to go wild to defy authority and break the law to be verbally combative belligerent or threatening or followed by the preposition on to dominate or humiliate26 the concept emerged as gilligan talked with his fellow xfiles writer thomas schnauz regarding their current unemployment and joked that the solution was for them to put a meth lab in the back of an rv and drive around the country cooking meth and making money27 after writing the concept for the show and pilot gilligan pitched it to sony pictures television who became very interested in supporting it sony arranged for meetings with the various cable networks showtime passed on this as they had already started broadcasting weeds a show with similarities to the premise of breaking bad28 while his producers convinced him that the show was different enough to still be successful gilligan later stated that he would not have gone forward with the idea had he known about weeds earlier29 other networks like hbo and tnt also passed on the idea but eventually fx took interest and began initial discussions on producing the pilot28 at the same time fx had also started development of dirt a femalecentric crimebased drama series and with three existing malecentric shows already on the network fx passed up breaking bad for dirt28 one of gilligans agents spoke to jeremy elice the director of original programming for amc who was looking for more original shows to add alongside their upcoming mad men elice was intrigued and soon a meeting was set up between gilligan elice and two programming executives gilligan was not optimistic about this meeting fearing they would just put him off but instead all three showed great interest and the meeting ended up establishing how amc would acquire the rights from fx and set the pilot into production it took about a year following this meeting before sony had set up the rights with amc and production could start28 development historyedit breaking bad was filmed at various locations across albuquerque clockwise from top left the house used for the whites home the fast food restaurant that was used for los pollos hermanos the crossroads motels used inshow for various drug deals a rental home used for janes and jesses apartment the car wash where walter works parttime and the doghouse a functioning drivein restaurant the network ordered nine episodes for the first season including the pilot but the 200708 writers guild of america strike limited the production to seven episodes as well as delaying the start of production for the second season30 within the original nineepisode arc gilligan had planned to kill off jesse or hank as a ballsy moment to end the season on24 this death was eliminated with the limited episode count which gilligan found to be a net positive given the strength of acting that both paul and norris brought to these roles through the seasons24 the strike also helped to slow down production long enough for gilligan and his writing team to readjust the pacing of the show which in the original arc had been moving too quickly24 gould stated that the writers strike saved the show as if they had produced the two additional episodes in the first season they would have gone down a different creative path that he believes would have led to the shows cancellation by its third season31 the initial versions of the script were set in riverside california but at the suggestion of sony albuquerque was chosen for the productions location due to the favorable financial conditions offered by the state of new mexico once gilligan recognized that this would mean wed always have to be avoiding the sandia mountains in shots directed toward the east the story setting was changed to the actual production location3233 it was shot primarily on 35 mm film34 with digital cameras employed as needed for additional angles point of view shots and timelapse photography35 breaking bad cost 3 million per episode to produce higher than the average cost for a basic cable program36 around 2010 amc had expressed to sony pictures television and gilligan that they felt that the third season would be the last for breaking bad sony started to shop the show around having gained quick interest from the fx network for two more seasons upon which amc changed its mind and allowed the show to continue37 at the same time netflix was starting to aggressively shop for content to add to its service and arranged a deal with sony for breaking bad to be available after the airing of the fourth season knowing that amc had placed breaking bad on a potential cancellation route sony pushed to have the show added to the service in time for the fourth season breaking bads viewership grew greatly as viewers binged the series on netflix helping to assure that a fifth season could be made the fifthseason premiere had more than double the viewership compared to the fourth season premiere attributed to the netflix availability37 gilligan thanked netflix at the emmy awards in september 2013 after the series conclusion for the popularity of the series saying that netflix kept us on the air38 as the series progressed gilligan and the writing staff of breaking bad made walter increasingly unsympathetic21 gilligan said during the run of the series hes going from being a protagonist to an antagonist we want to make people question who theyre pulling for and why22 cranston said by the fourth season i think walts figured out its better to be a pursuer than the pursued hes well on his way to badass23 in july 2011 vince gilligan indicated that he intended to conclude breaking bad at the end of its fifth season39 in early august 2011 negotiations began over a deal regarding the fifth and possible final season between the network amc and sony pictures television the production company of the series amc proposed a shortened fifth season six to eight episodes instead of 13 to cut costs but the producers declined sony then approached other cable networks about possibly picking up the show if a deal could not be made40 on august 14 2011 amc renewed the series for a fifth and final season consisting of 16 episodes41 in april 2012 bryan cranston revealed that the fifth season would be split into two halves with the first eight episodes airing in 2012 and the final eight in 201342 before the series finale gilligan said that it was difficult to write for walter white because the character was so dark and morally questionable im going to miss the show when its over but on some level itll be a relief to not have walt in my head anymore43 gilligan later said the idea for walters character intrigued him so much that he didnt really give much thought on how well it would sell stating that he would have given up on the premise since it was such an odd dark story that could have difficulties being pitched to studios27 ultimately gilligan chose to end breaking bad with walters death occurring instory two years after he had first been diagnosed with cancer and given two years to live gilligan said by the end of the series it feels as if we should adhere to our promise that we explicitly made to our audience from the first episode44 castingedit youre going to see that underlying humanity even when hes making the most devious terrible decisions and you need someone who has that humanity deep down bedrock humanity so you say watching this show all right ill go for this ride i dont like what hes doing but i understand and ill go with it for as far as it goes if you dont have a guy who gives you that despite the greatest acting chops in the world the show is not going to succeed vince gilligan about bryan cranston45 breaking bad creator vince gilligan cast bryan cranston for the role of walter white based on having worked with him in the drive episode of the science fiction television series the xfiles on which gilligan worked as a writer cranston played an antisemite with a terminal illness who took series coprotagonist fox mulder david duchovny hostage gilligan said the character had to be simultaneously loathsome and sympathetic and that bryan alone was the only actor who could do that who could pull off that trick and it is a trick i have no idea how he does it4345 amc officials who were initially reluctant with the casting choice having known cranston only as the overthetop character hal on the comedy series malcolm in the middle approached actors john cusack and matthew broderick about the role46 when both actors declined the executives were persuaded to cast cranston after seeing his xfiles episode47 cranston contributed significantly to the formation and development of the walter white persona when gilligan left much of walters past unexplained during the development of the series the actor wrote his own backstory for the character43 at the start of the show cranston gained 10 pounds to reflect the characters personal decline and had the natural red highlights of his hair dyed brown he collaborated with costume designer kathleen detoro on a wardrobe of mostly neutral green and brown colors to make the character bland and unremarkable and worked with makeup artist frieda valenzuela to create a mustache he described as impotent and like a dead caterpillar48 cranston repeatedly identified elements in certain scripts where he disagreed with how the character was handled49 and went so far as to call gilligan directly when he could not work out disagreements with the episodes screenwriters cranston has said he was inspired partially by his elderly father for how walter carries himself physically which he described as a little hunched over never erect as if the weight of the world is on this mans shoulders in contrast to his character cranston has been described as extremely playful on set with aaron paul describing him as a kid trapped in a mans body43 aaron pauls casting was also initially questioned by production as paul looked too old and too much of a pretty boy to be associated with meth cooking gilligan reconsidered pauls skills after seeing his audition and recalling he had also had guest starred on the xfiles episode lord of the flies28 gilligan originally intended for pinkman to be killed at the end of breaking bads first season in a botched drug deal as a plot device to plague walter white with guilt however gilligan said by the second episode of the season he was so impressed with pauls performance that it became pretty clear early on that that would be a huge colossal mistake to kill off jesse50 similarly dean norris had shown his ability to be a law enforcement official in the xfiles episode f emasculata and was brought on to be hank schrader walters brotherinlaw and dea agent51 scientific accuracyedit donna nelson a professor of organic chemistry at the university of oklahoma checked scripts and provided dialogue she also drew chemical structures and wrote chemical equations which were used as props according to creator vince gilligan dr donna nelson from the university of oklahoma approached us several seasons back and said i really like this show and if you ever need help with the chemistry id love to lend a hand shes been a wonderful advisor we get help wherever we need it whether its chemistry electrical engineering or physics we try to get everything correct theres no fulltime advisor on set but we run certain scenes by these experts first52 because walter white was talking to his students i was able to dumb down certain moments of description and dialogue in the early episodes which held me until we had some help from some honesttogod chemists says gilligan according to gilligan nelson vets our scripts to make sure our chemistry dialogue is accurate and up to date we also have a chemist with the drug enforcement administration based out of dallas who has just been hugely helpful to us53 nelson spoke of gilligans interest in having the science right saying that gilligan said it made a difference to him54 the gas mask worn when characters would cook meth in breaking bad is on display at the mob museum in las vegas several episodes of mythbusters featured attempts to validate or disprove scenes from breaking bad often with gilligan gueststarring in the episode to participate in 2013 two scenes from the first season of breaking bad were put under scrutiny in a mythbusters breaking bad special despite several modifications to what was seen in the show both the scenes depicted in the show were shown to be physically impossible55 it was shown impossible to use hydrofluoric acid to fully dissolve metal flesh or ceramic as shown in the episode cats in the bag and that while it was possible to throw fulminated mercury against the floor to cause an explosion as in the episode crazy handful of nothin walter would have needed a much larger quantity of the compound and thrown at a much faster speed and likely would have killed all in the room5657 a later mythbusters episode blow it out of the water tested the possibility of mounting an automated machine gun in a car as in the series finale felina and found it plausible58 an episode of mythbusters jr proved that it was impossible for an electromagnet to draw metallic objects from across a room as in the episode live free or die59 jason wallach of vice magazine commended the accuracy of the cooking methods presented in the series in early episodes a oncecommon clandestine method the nagai red phosphorusiodine method is depicted which uses pseudoephedrine as a precursor to dmethamphetamine60 by the season 1 finale walt chooses to use a different synthetic route based on the difficulty of acquiring enough pseudoephedrine to produce on the larger scale required the new method walt chooses is a reductive amination reaction relying on phenyl2propanone and methylamine on the show the phenyl2propanone otherwise known as phenylacetone or p2p is produced from phenylacetic acid and acetic acid using a tube furnace and thorium dioxide tho2 as a catalyst as mentioned in episodes a no roughstufftype deal and m√°s p2p and methylamine form an imine intermediate reduction of this p2pmethylamine imine intermediate is performed using mercury aluminum amalgam as shown in several episodes including hazard pay61 the meth in each episode was blue candy created by the employees at the candy lady one of the important plot points in the series is that the crystal meth walter cooks has very long crystals is very pure and despite its purity has a strong cyan blue color pure crystal meth would be colorless or white62 in their article die chemie bei breaking bad on chemie in unserer zeit translated into english on chemistryviews as the chemistry of breaking bad tunga salthammer and falk harnish discuss the plausibility of the chemistry portrayed in certain scenes according to the two chemistry is clearly depicted as a manufacturing science without much explanation of analytical methods being provided they also note that serious scientific subjects are mixed into the dialogue in order to show a world where chemistry plays a key role62 technical aspectsedit michael slovis was the cinematographer of breaking bad beginning with the second season and he received critical acclaim for his work throughout the series critics appreciated the bold visual style adopted by the tv series although series creator vince gilligan and slovis wanted to shoot breaking bad in cinemascope sony and amc did not grant them permission gilligan cited sergio leones westerns as a reference for how he wanted the series to look63 slovis received four primetime emmy award nominations for outstanding cinematography for a one hour series and outstanding cinematography for a singlecamera series64 breaking bad was shot on 35 mm film because of the robustness of the equipment and to keep a focus on shooting scenes economically it also allowed for a later digital transfer to 4k ultra hd resolution65 by the end of the fifth season episodes had cost upwards of us6 million to produce37 kelley dixon was one of the few editors of breaking bad and edited many of the series meth montages for the montages she would use techniques such as jump cuts and alternating the speed of the film either faster or slower66 for her work she received six primetime emmy award nominations for outstanding singlecamera picture

wounded by his own weapon walt dies from his wounds in jacks meth lab themesedit moral consequencesedit in an interview with the new york times gilligan said the larger lesson of the series is that actions have consequences43 he elaborated on the shows philosophy if religion is a reaction of man and nothing more it seems to me that it represents a human desire for wrongdoers to be punished i hate the idea of idi amin living in saudi arabia for the last 25 years of his life that galls me to no end i feel some sort of need for biblical atonement or justice or something i like to believe there is some comeuppance that karma kicks in at some point even if it takes years or decades to happen my girlfriend says this great thing thats become my philosophy as well i want to believe theres a heaven but i cant not believe theres a hell in a piece comparing the show to the sopranos mad men and the wire chuck klosterman said that breaking bad is built on the uncomfortable premise that theres an irrefutable difference between whats right and whats wrong and its the only one where the characters have real control over how they choose to live klosterman added that the central question of breaking bad is what makes a man bad his actions his motives or his conscious decision to be a bad person klosterman concluded that in the world of breaking bad goodness and badness are simply complicated choices no different than anything else20 ross douthat of the new york times in a response to klostermans piece compared breaking bad and the sopranos stating that both series are morality

even if he is unloved82 in the final episode of the series walt finally admits to skyler that the main motivation for his endeavors in the meth business was his own interest in spite of secretly securing the 972 million he had managed to salvage for her and the children jesses loneliness in the early seasons of the show can be partly explained by his parents decision to kick him out of their home due to his drugrelated activities this parental disconnect brings him closer to jane whose father berates her for her drug use when walt crosses paths with janes father walt refers to jesse as his nephew and laments the fact that he can not get through to him janes father responds by telling him to keep trying saying family you cant give up on them ever what else is there83 janes subsequent

you no and he goes back to jesse pinkman and says lets cook and that was where the character truly got interesting for me this guys got some serious pride issues85 the critically acclaimed episode ozymandias references the percy bysshe shelley poem of the same name which describes the crumbling legacy of an overly prideful king8687 the episode draws parallels to the poem as both antiheroes are left with little to show for their empirebuilding efforts austin gill of xavier university stated the episode evokes the tyrannical aspirations of invincibility and arrogance of ozymandias himself as represented in shelleys poem88 douglas eric rasmussen of the university of saskatchewan argued that the concept of hubris and being punished for grandiose projects that serve an individuals egotism are central aspects of each work89 hanks death marks the beginning of a shift where it becomes increasingly difficult for walt to continue to insist that he cooks meth for the sake of his familys
