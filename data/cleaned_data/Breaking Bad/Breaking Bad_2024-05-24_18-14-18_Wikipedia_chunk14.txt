times episode 200 indy car specialedit original air date may 22 2013 man vs caredit myth status notes in a 30foot 91 m race a human can outrun a race car busted at the indianapolis motor speedway in speedway indiana jamie and adam each took turns driving the race car while the other tried to outrun it each tried three times and adam had one dead heat with the race car but they both ultimately failed to beat it they then enlisted olympic runner wallace spearmon to race against indycar series driver ryan briscoe with the latter winning by a comfortable margin every time manhole mishapedit myth status notes during an indycar series road race race cars can generate enough suction against the ground while driving to remove manhole covers from their manholes busted adam and jamie installed a mock manhole cover inside a mock manhole that was dug by the owners of the indianapolis motor speedway adding weights to the bottom because the cover itself weighed less than a real one they attached highstrength line to the cover so it could only move half an inch finally indycar series racer logan gomez drove over the manhole cover at 100 and 150 miles per hour 240 kmh but failed to impart enough force to move it after removing the weights for a final test the car imparted 37 poundsforce 160 n on the manhole cover which was just barely enough to move it at all and would certainly not be enough to move a real manhole cover sweaty speededit myth status notes during an indycar series race a driver can lose 10 pounds 45 kg plausible as a control test the build team spent three hours the length of an indianapolis 500 race in a dry sauna grant and kari lost 1 pound 045 kg each while tory lost 2 pounds 091 kg next tory spent three hours driving a race car around the indianapolis motor speedway but only lost 3 pounds 14 kg as a final test the build team drove laps for three hours around thunderhill raceway park kari lost 55 pounds 25 kg tory lost 5 pounds 23 kg and grant lost 45 pounds 20 kg although it was not the amount required by the myth they deemed it plausible due to the much more extreme circumstances in a longer and faster race such as the indianapolis 500 episode 201 battle of the sexes round 2edit original air date may 29 2013 man throwedit myth status notes men are better at throwing objects than women based on the insult of throwing like a girl towards a grown male ie throwing with less power than needed busted adam and jamie selected a female and a male from each of four age groups 7 12 18 and 24yearolds in the first test which involved throwing tennis balls at a target the females threw more accurately than the males but not as fast they repeated the test with the 7 and 24yearolds in a motion capture studio at industrial light magic in order to analyze the subjects body movements while throwing and noted that the females tended to throw while keeping their bodies upright while the males leaned forward more closely resembling the movement of professional baseball pitcher greg reynolds in the final test which had the subjects use their nonpreferred hands to make throws the males threw more accurately but not as fast a reversal of the first test additionally all subjects showed the same form when using their nonpreferred hands regardless of gender finally adam and jamie enlisted softball pitcher jordan taylor for the test and found that her form was identical to that of greg reynolds the mythbusters declared the myth busted on the basis that throwing objects is a skill that can be learned with equal effectiveness by both genders and that any perceived difference is due to cultural bias that exposes males to more ball sports multitasking talentedit myth status notes women are better at multitasking than men confirmed the build team devised a morning routine test where the subjects had to get dressed iron clothes make tea toast and a sandwich within five minutes while answering three trivia questions over a cell phone and ensuring that a robotic baby buster did not crawl outside of a marked zone within the stage area each test subject began with a base score of 100 with deductions of 10 points apiece for failed or incomplete tasks ten women achieved an average score of 72 while ten men averaged 64 additionally the only perfect score of the test was scored by a woman ask for directionsedit myth status notes men do not ask for directions as often as women when they get lost busted adam and jamie set up a test where the subject was instructed to follow a set of directions that included one intentional misdirection in the area of an intersection surrounded by volunteers that the subjects could ask for directions ten men and ten women took the test with nine people from each gender asking for directions the tie was resolved by the fact that the men spent an average of 411 driving before asking for directions while the women spent an average of 511 before doing the same busting the myth parking poweredit myth status notes women are better at parallel parking than men busted kari and tory judged as ten men and ten women took turns parallel parking scoring was based on a starting score of 100 with deductions for not centering the car properly bumping into the cars in front of and behind the parking car and any corrections or reattempts the men had scores that were consistently average and mediocre while the women fluctuated wildly between great and terrible scores ultimately the men scored a 436 average and the women scored a 425 average too close to discern a statistical difference observation skillsedit this segment was cut from the episode when it aired in the united states myth status notes women are better at observation than men5 plausible in a replication of the simonschabris invisible gorilla test designed to measure general inattentional blindness ten men and ten women were shown a video of two threeman teams passing basketballs and were told to count the number of times a white team member passed a basketball while the true aim was to see if the subjects could spot a zombie kari in a costume walking amongst the action only one man and two women were able to do so successfully leading the build team to call the myth plausible due to the marginal results episode 202 motorcycle water skiedit original us air date june 5 2013 original australia air date may 6 2013 motorcycle mayhemedit myth status notes a motorcycle moving at freeway speed can ride across the surface of a lake as demonstrated in a youtube viral video confirmed but not recommended adam and jamie set up a smallscale test using a remotecontrolled toy motorcycle and a fabricated small pond of scaled depth but in all their test runs the highspeed camera showed the rc motorcycle riding mostly along the bottom of the pond they next attempted to see if a motorcycle could actually achieve buoyancy on water to do this they built a rig to attach a motorcycle wheel to the side of a speedboat and despite some initial difficulties getting the boat up to speed solved by having jamie counterbalance the added weight on the rear of the boat by lying on the bow were eventually able to get the tire to skim on the surface at 60 miles per hour 97 kmh they then enlisted ama supercross veteran eric mccrummen for a full scale test mccrummen successfully rode his motorcycle across 50 ft 15 m and then 100 ft 30 m of open water with a depth of 3 feet 091 m confirming the myth finally jamie attempted to ride across a very long stretch of open water to determine if the motorcycle was merely skipping across the surface on existing momentum or was in fact able to generate power while on top of the water he sank after riding about 300 feet 91 m homemade parachuteedit myth status notes a criminal holed up in a hotel room could have jumped to safety from 20 stories without injury using a parachute constructed in 3 hours from materials in the room busted the build team decided to attempt building their own parachutes individually with each having access to the same materials as the criminal would have had and a 3hour time limit despite each successfully constructing a differently shaped parachute out of different materials within the time limit none of the parachutes were able to slow busters descent when dropped from a 20story height by a crane enough to prevent him from sustaining a lethal gforce in excess of 100 g with grants design faring the best at 144 g the team followed up by testing various materials common to hotel rooms against actual parachute material by weight and air resistance using the results along with mathematical calculations to construct a best case parachute out of shower curtains while buster survived a drop from 30 stories with this final parachute with no injuries sustaining a gforce of only 42 g the team declared the myth busted because the final parachute required far more material a whole floor of roomss worth of shower curtains as opposed to a single room and more time to construct than the criminal would have had available to him as well as involving significant design challenges episode 203 hypermilingcrash cushionsedit original us air date june 12 2013 original australia air date may 27 2013 crash cushionedit myth status notes a person seated between overweight policemen in the backseat of a car can survive the impact of a tbone collision from a truck driving at highway speed based on a scene in the film headhunters busted for the smallscale test adam built a scale model of the car from the movie out of polycarbonate and small leather pouches filled with a water balloon to simulate the overweight policemen when hit from the side with a large tree stump a minibuster seated alone in the backseat of the model car sustained a lethal gforce of 150 g but a survivable 30 g when placed between the two simulated policemen giving the myth plausibility for the fullscale experiment adam and jamie modified the beast previously seen in the final jato rocket car revisit with a large steel plate welded in front when they used the beast to tbone the actual car from the movie at 50 miles per hour 80 kmh the mythbusters to their shock achieved the opposite result a simulated cadaver placed between two 350 lb 159 kg simulated policemen crafted by adam and jamie out of foam and rubber then filled with water in the backseat sustained more lethal injuries including a full decapitation and maxed out gforce sensors at over 800 g as compared with a control test with the simulated cadaver alone in the backseat where the damage and gforce numbers at 500600 g while still very much lethal were noticeably better jamie speculated the reason for this may be the human body largely being made up of water and waters lack of compressibility thus making the human body ineffective as a cushion hypermilingedit myth status notes you can use various hypermiling techniques in concert with each other to double the fuel efficiency of your car busted the build team began by individually testing the legal hypermiling techniques that the show had yet to examine driving at a slower speed on the highway accelerating and braking in as slow and smooth a fashion as possible and turning off the engine when idling at a red light all of the individual tests showed an increase in fuel efficiency of about 30 for the hypermiling technique compared with standard technique they then proceeded to perform tests on two different vehicles kari and grant in a new vehicle tory in an older vehicle with 75000 miles 121000 km on the engine comparing standard driving with a combination of all hypermiling techniques with each car getting 3usgallon 11 l of gas for both the control and hypermiling test kari and grants car traveled 64 miles 103 km for the control and 90 miles 140 km for the hypermiling test a 40 gain compared with torys figures of 78 miles 126 km and 136 miles 219 km respectively a 70 gain despite declaring the myth busted the build team noted the effectiveness of hypermiling techniques in improving the fuel efficiency of a car episode 204 duct tape canyonedit original air date june 19 2013 the build team does not appear in this episode duct tape canyon specialedit in this spiritual successor to duct tape island adam and jamie are stranded in a barren wasteland near desolation canyon utah with only duct tape bubble wrap and a few other basic staples eg food water and a knife and must depend on these limited resources to cross the canyon and reach civilization features a cameo appearance by nik wallenda to promote the discovery channel special skywire live which aired the weekend following the original airing of this episode adam and jamies goals were to myth status notes find the canyon confirmed to survive the temperature which was around 0 c 32 f at the time adam and jamie wrapped themselves in ponchos made from bubble wrap and held together with duct tape they then found a nearby mesa from which to survey the turf and locate the canyon make shelter and a fire confirmed jamie used duct tape to forge a lowhanging tent to sleep in while lying on a mattress of bubble pack while adam slept in the car they used to get stranded adam was also able to use sparks from the cars battery to make a fire after making duct tape handles for the batterys wires which tended to get hot carry their supplies across the desert confirmed jamie used large branches and duct tape to construct a travois to haul most of the supplies while adam made a bag and several yards of rope out of duct tape along the way to the canyon they modified their shoes for further comfort while hiking by cutting out the toes and wrapping them in duct tape descend safely into the canyon confirmed the mythbusters tied several of the ropes together and used them to slowly climb down one of the walls of the canyon taking advantage of a few ledges and footholds along the way they descended a total distance of 150 feet 46 m paddle along rapids to the end of the canyon partly confirmed before building any boats to use adam was first wrapped in a thick suit of bubble wrap and duct tape intending for it to be insulated and waterproof however cold water started to seep in after a short time and adam soon lost his ability to control himself due to the added buoyancy of the bubble wrap so to brave the rapids they built two separate crafts out of bubble wrap pontoons held together by duct tape jamie made a large raft that resembled an inflatable pool sofa and adam constructed a long kayak they each took their boats out onto the river and paddled downstream where they repeatedly faced rapids of increasing difficulty until they eventually reached a class 5 rapid adam rode first but his boat soon flipped and he fell out forcing him to ride the rest of the rapids outside of the boat he managed to survive and found a large rock afterwards on which to rest and reenter the boat jamie handled the rapids by using the rocks to stand on as he carried his boat through narrow gaps then rode the rest of the way without any problems they discovered a waterfall soon after and decided to bypass it on land instead of attempting to ride down they used some more rope to climb down a 25 feet 76 m cliff past the waterfall after which they paddled their boats out of the canyon and headed for civilization episode 205 painting with explosivesbifurcated boatedit original air date june 26 2013 this was the second of two 10th anniversary episodes painting with explosivesedit adam and jamie decided to revisit the myth of painting with explosives based on the episode doityourself mr bean of the british comedy series mr bean starring rowan atkinson they tested to find out if a small room could be painted with explosives using myth status notes adams snowflake frame no result after some preliminary tests at the bomb range attempting to use c4 to spread paint onto a canvas adam found the most effective method was using detasheet spread behind a bag of paint he then built a large sixdirectional frame and placed canvases on the six ends when the explosive detonated each of the canvases ended up almost entirely covered in paint though successful it was not actually an attempt to paint a room and thus it was not given a busted plausible or confirmed rating jamies steel sphere busted jamies device in this episode6 jamie first experimented with various nozzle shapes until he found one that created a large rectangular spread of paint he also conducted preliminary tests at the bomb range using a scuba tank filled with explosives with the nozzle attached but it failed to paint the wall in a better spread than a scuba tank without the nozzle jamie surmised that the energy from the explosive wasnt properly spraying the paint out through the nozzle in the intended fashion because the scuba tank was cylindrical so he built a large heavyduty spherical tank dubbed a death star by jd nelson out of specially cut steel circles with nozzles in four directions he then placed his tank within a small room with four walls with the nozzles facing the walls and placed dynamite and paint inside the tank when the dynamite went off the paint sprayed to cover hardly any of the area of the walls bifurcated boatedit myth status notes a boat moving at 25 miles per hour 40 kmh can be split down the middle by hitting a channel marker a revisit of the 2007 myth bifurcated boat rebusted as per fan requests the build team decided to test the myth on water contrasting the previous tests on land they also used a wooden channel marker instead of the metal one used in the previous tests they planted their channel marker in a small part of the lake then set up two boats to tow a third one dubbed mythity split 2 into the channel marker before they could test however a barge suddenly appeared and knocked over their channel marker creating a bad omen that the curse of the bifurcated boat was returning undaunted the team planted a second channel marker and towed their boat into it at 25 mph which ended up splitting the marker instead of the boat rebusting the myth to split the boat once and for all they traveled to the new mexico institute of mining and technology to use their rocket sled instead of propelling the boat towards a channel marker fearing that the boat would disintegrate they placed a metal pole on the sled and propelled it using two rocket motors it traveled toward the boat at 200 miles per hour 320 kmh and finally split the boat in two episode 206 breaking bad specialedit original us air date august 12 2013 original australia air date july 15 2013 this episode features myths drawn from the amc drama series breaking bad which had been teased since it was reported as early as the year before by entertainment weekly7 guesting in this episode are show creatorproducer vince gilligan and costarring actor aaron paul jesse pinkman the episode had already been aired in several international markets such as on sbsone on july 15 2013 and on discovery channel southeast asia on july 22 2013 before making its us debut on august 12 2013 the late us airing was timed to coincide with breaking bads final season second half premiere the night before myth status notes concentrated hydrofluoric acid in a bathtub can completely destroy a human body and eat a hole through the tub and the bathroom floor below it from the season 1 episode cats in the bag busted at ucberkeley adam and jamie observed as 100ml portions of the acid were poured onto samples of seven materials that would have been present in the bathroom steel wood linoleum drywall ceramiccoated cast iron ceramic alone and pig flesh to represent the human body after 8 hours of soaking the materials had deteriorated to various degrees but none had been completely destroyed adam noted that although fluorine is the most reactive of the halogens it forms the weakest acid of the group when it combines with hydrogen jamie brought in a load of concentrated sulfuric acid along with a second chemical that he referred to as special sauce to increase its corrosive ability he and adam built a bathroom set at a sanitary landfill with a catch tank to contain any spills and filled its castiron tub with 35 pounds 16 kg of pig carcass parts and 6 us gallons 23 l of the acidsauce mixture this liquid volume was three times the amount used in the actual scene the tub contents eventually began to bubble smoke and give off large amounts of heat however some solid material remained after 20 minutes and neither the tub nor the floor leaked acting on suggestions from vince and aaron adam and jamie decided to use a larger quantity of acidsauce 36 us gallons 140 l and a tub made from a more susceptible material fiberglass degraded quickly when exposed to the acid so the two set up a fullscale test using it for their tub once the mixture was added the reaction was so vigorous that the entire set was briefly hidden under thick clouds of smoke after 5 minutes adam and jamie found only a black organic sludge in the tub although large amounts of liquid had boiled over the side neither the tub nor the floor had been eaten through since they were unable to replicate the scene they declared the myth busted although the sauce was never explicitly identified jamie mentioned that the sauce had a lot of hydrogen and oxygen and adam said the concentration was 30citation needed based on this description the chemical being referred to was likely hydrogen peroxide thus creating a solution commonly known as piranha solution confirmed at adam savages san diego comic con 2015 panel8 jamie noted that what he and adam saw in the aftermath in the tub matched in contents with what fell through the ceiling after the reaction in the episode crazy handfuledit myth status notes a chunk of solid mercury fulminate will explode if thrown on the ground and the blast will killinjure bystanders and break the windows without injuring the thrower from the season 1 episode crazy handful of nothin busted at a remote rock quarry the build team enlisted the help of explosives consultant jesse taylor to make a batch of the compound which is sensitive to mechanical shock they started with a charge of 5 grams placed inside a pumpkin and detonated with an explosive squib the blast obliterated the pumpkin grant built a robot to throw the charge down with typical human force while kari and tory built a room identical to the one used in the show scene they placed mannequins at appropriate positions and set rupture discs next to each calibrated to burst at 13 pounds per square inch 90 kpa injury and 75 pounds per square inch 520 kpa death a charge of 50 grams failed to explode when thrown down but vince imagined that walter may have mixed a quantity of even more sensitive silver fulminate into the batch the team fitted their 50gram charge with a blasting cap to ensure it would explode then set it off the injury discs burst on this trial but none of the windows blew out in an attempt to replicate the explosion in the scene jesse made a 250gram batch and the team set it off as in the second trial this time the resulting explosion broke the windows burst every rupture disc and blew the walls and ceiling apart because 5 times more explosive was required than used in the show the team declared the myth busted as a postscript in the 2015 episode blow it out of the water adam and jamie with gilligan present also tested the viability of walters juryrigged car trunk machine gun trap in felina the breaking bad series finale and found it plausible episode 207 zombie specialedit original air date october 17 2013 this special episode was timed to air in the us immediately following the discovery channel special apocalypse preppers and in the same week as the season 4 premiere of the walking dead features a special guest appearance by michael rooker who portrayed merle dixon in seasons 13 of the walking dead axe vs gunedit myth status notes an axe is a more effective weapon against a horde of zombies than a gun confirmed in preparation for testing and to ensure the zombie volunteers safety adam and jamie fashioned plastic masks to protect the volunteers faces from paintball gunshots while adam fashioned an axehead out of foam that would leave a paint mark when used to strike additionally michael rooker coached the volunteers in the zombie shuffle form of movement that would be used consistently for all tests throughout the episode for the test itself adam and jamie marked off a human zone 30 feet 91 m in diameter inside a hangar on start the zombies would approach the human zone with adam and jamie forbidden from engaging a zombie until it entered the human zone adam using the foam axe averaged 14 kills across two runs while jamie using a modified shotgun only averaged 7 kills across two runs despite declaring the myth confirmed adam and jamie would acknowledge practical limitations and issues with the parameters of the test in the episodes aftershow9 dead heatedit myth status notes it is impossible to outrun or escape from a massively large zombie horde busted the build team set up a postapocalyptic obstacle course on the alameda runway in which 150 zombie volunteers would be dispersed over varying amounts of space to simulate various population densities the volunteers were given a set of rules for their behavior gleaned from information tory received in a consultation with the walking dead sfx artist gregory nicotero the zombie threat was simulated by small brains attached to their clothes allowing a zombie to grab one would be counted as failure kari successfully crossed a horde similar in density to the population of manhattan while tory survived a horde the density of overpopulated areas of mumbai however grant faced with the highest density known to mankind 180000 people per square mile was unsuccessful in escaping the horde the team then tried various techniques to see if they could divert the hordes attention away from them so as to successfully traverse this largest population density kari used tory as a sacrifice and grant used a robotic decoy both tactics were successful tory opted to disguise himself as a zombie and blend in with the horde but was recognized midway through his run and could not escape despite this the team declared the myth busted since the horde could be escaped from through both speed and technique power of the pushedit myth status notes a zombie horde can collectively force their way through any barricaded door busted for this test adam and jamie placed a steel frame inside the archway of a nineteenthcentury barn as a place to install a series of doubledoored gateways the safety precautions for this test involved all zombie volunteers and adam who participated in this test as one of the zombies wearing cutouts of polyethylene sewer pipes in order to prevent the volunteers from accidentally stumbling over and being trampled on the first run using rickety wood doors held in place by a single twobyfour the doors gave way almost immediately when the zombie horde haphazardly pushed up against it the second run using doors of more robust wood with a single twobyfour didnt fare much better as it gave way with a single coordinated push by the horde however after jamie and michael reinforced the second set of doors with as much available wood as was on hand the horde was unable to penetrate the doors on the third run thus busting the myth referencesedit a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o mythbusters 2013 episode guide discovery channel discovery communications archived from the
