this episode episode 197 jato rocket car mission accomplishededit original air date may 1 2013 this was the first of two 10th anniversary episodes jato 3 mission accomplishededit myth status notes a car with a jato rocket attached can speed up to 300 miles per hour 480 kmh become airborne and impact with the side of a cliff a revisit of the jet assisted chevy myth from the first pilot episode rebusted for this experiment adam and jamie planned the particulars for two launches while the build team modified a large dump truck with a protective metal cage around the exterior of the cab for use as a mobile command bunker later dubbed the beast the first test involved a chevrolet impala with five rockets attached fired as it approached a line of 50pound 23 kg sandbags the car crossed the sandbags at over 200 miles per hour 320 kmh but only managed to get airborne by flipping and tumbling when adam lost control of it there was no indication that the sandbags had contributed to the car leaving the ground the second test involved a second impala with six rockets attached launched off a giant ramp as in the supersized myths special this time the car hit the ramp perfectly straight and was launched into the air but it immediately began tumbling and landed about 600 feet 180 m away the team came to the conclusion that the myth scenario is impossible simply because cars are not shaped like rockets and are therefore not aerodynamic in a way that supports flight episode 198 deadliest catch crabtastic specialedit original air date may 8 2013 this episode aired out of order on discovery channel in the united states as the smallscale test for killer loop briefly referenced the smallscale test for crash cushion for all three myths adam jamie tory kari and grant were joined by two deadliest catch captains fv time bandit captain johnathan hillstrand and seabrooke captain scott campbell jr killer loopedit myth status notes a fisherman can be pulled to the bottom of the ocean if he is caught in a coiled rope attached to a sinking crab pot plausible a scale model test showed that overunder coiling was more effective in pulling someone overboard than regular coiling but regular coiling was used for the fullscale test as it is a more common technique to be used on a crab boat all tests in which buster was standing up or leaning on the pot launcher failed to work buster would get caught on the pot launcher however a final test with buster leaning over the rail finally resulted in him going overboard when buster was recovered his depth gauge read 100 feet 30 m and he was still attached to the rope in the same place it caught him jamie and adam declared the myth plausible since getting caught in the coil does not guarantee that the person will go overboard but remarked that if one were to go overboard they would in fact be pulled all the way to the bottom crab nappingedit inspired by bering sea crab boat shifts lasting as long as 30 hours which leads to some captains swearing by this myth myth status notes working a 30hour shift with a 20minute nap every six hours results in double the performance of not getting any sleep confirmed kari and tory went onto an anchored ship and set up an obstacle course featuring tasks that a bering sea crab boat deckhand could expect to face including throwing a hook sorting crab dodging mock versions of crab pots answering navigation questions and a steady hand test with a total 100 possible points kari and tory both got perfect scores for their fully rested control and then ran two tests after 30 hours awake with the difference being that the second included the 20minute crab naps without the crab naps kari scored 27 and tory scored 34 but after adding in the naps kari and tory successfully doubled their scores in the retest and then some with scores of 64 and 81 indestructible potedit myth status notes crab pots are indestructible busted after the build team declared that any damage to the steel frame would have constituted some destruction the first test with 3 lb 1 kg of c4 suspended inside the pot failed to damage the steel however a second test with the same amount of c4 strategically placed below the pot in direct contact with the frame damaged the steel in multiple places as a result johnathan and scott treated the build team to dinner episode 199 down and dirtyearthquake survivaledit original air date may 15 2013 down and dirtyedit myth status notes hand dryers in public restrooms are a less effective method of removing bacteria from ones hands after washing than paper towels and spread more bacteria around the drying area confirmed first to find out if washing hands even leaves behind any bacteria to be removed by hand dryers adam and jamie tested three different commonly used methods of washing hands each followed by swabbing and incubating in petri dishes rubbing hands together without placing them under the water getting hands wet but neglecting to use any soap and washing hands with soap and water which is the proper method they discovered that washing their hands with soap and water yielded no bacteria whatsoever whereas washing without soap left a fairly substantial amount of bacteria and attempting to wash without water left far too much to count next they enlisted 16 volunteers to have their hands sprayed with a harmless strain of escherichia coli bacteria then swabbed for a sample then washed using water but no soap then swabbed again then dried using paper towels then swabbed a third time then they repeated the process with the same volunteers bacteria and washing technique but using hand dryers instead on average the paper towels removed 71 of the bacteria on the volunteers hands while the hand dryers only removed 23 confirming the first part of the myth samples taken from swabbing the testing areas yielded 3 for the paper towels and 41 for the hand dryers confirming the second part stall number 1edit myth status notes in a public restroom the bathroom stall closest to the entrance is used the least often and contains the least amount of bacteria confirmed after 119 different men used a restroom with four bathroom stalls that had been freshly cleansed of all bacteria adam and jamie swabbed each of the stalls and counted the number of colonies of bacteria produced the stalls numbered in order from the closest to the entrance as 1 to the farthest as 4 had 162 267 290 and 231 colonies respectively in addition a tally of the users of each stall showed that the stalls were used by 23 38 34 and 24 people respectively earthquake emergencyedit myth status notes standing in a doorway yields the best chance of survival when an earthquake hits busted the build team built a 13 by 11 feet 40 m 34 m earthquake shaking table using pneumatic valve springs and air casters then had a small masonry house built on top of it they placed mannequins in three different locations inside the house one standing in the room one lying under a table and one standing in the doorway when they started up the shake table the masonry house began to collapse fairly quickly except for the doorframe the mannequins standing in the room and lying under the table suffered but the one in the doorway was subject only to being battered by the swinging door then they retested with a new house with a wooden frame and the mannequin standing inside was soon dispatched but the doorway and table mannequins remained intact after a final shake with enough force to simulate a magnitude 95 earthquake the doorway mannequin fell over leaving the underthetable mannequin the last one to survive despite the doorway testing as the best spot in the masonry house the build team declared the myth busted due to the high rarity of such houses in current
