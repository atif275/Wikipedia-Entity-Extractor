ceremony took place from september 14 to 17 2020 and on september 19 2020 the date listed next to each emmy category denotes when the corresponding award was given191 futureedit both vince gilligan and aaron paul regarded el camino as the proper conclusion to jesse pinkmans story with neither having immediate plans for a sequel after the films release71199 speculating on jesses new life in haines alaska following the events of el camino gilligan surmised that jesse would enjoy the brewery and maybe get a job with the ski manufacturer the very nice people of alaska would welcome him into the community71 paul believed that jesse is going to keep his nose clean he has quite a bit of cash on hand and hes going to live a very modest lifestyle hes moving to a very small place in alaska so he doesnt need all that much money he knows how to work with his hands and so he just needs to refresh those skills and become the artist that he was always meant to be13 however neither gilligan nor paul definitively ruled out the possibility of a sequel film to el camino1232 gilligan wanted to create a new story outside of the breaking bad franchise once he helped finish the final season of better call saul but indicated a slight chance of returning to jesses storyline if everyone still held interest212 he suggested a possible sequel could take place in haines71 paul said he would be interested in playing jesse again if gilligan felt he had more story to tell but highly doubted such a scenario could occur since the film gave the character a satisfying ending52 he also expressed a desire to work with gilligan again regardless if the project was related to breaking bad or not199 though paul signaled warmth to the idea of seeing jesses adventures in alaska he also declined the prospect of a new breaking bad season that would focus on him52200 paul would eventually reprise jesse pinkman again in better call sauls final season for two episodes with gilligan directing the second201 however his characters appearances canonically took place before the events of el camino202203 after the initial announcement of his gueststarring role paul reiterated that any other return as jesse pinkman required gilligans involvement47 gilligan reaffirmed he had no plans for any new entries in the breaking bad franchise shortly before better call saul concluded201 following the series finale paul said he felt confident that better call saul marked jesses final appearances and called it a farewell to his character204 notesedit during the events of buyout and say my name set
