of rolling stone detailed that while these scenes serve as a reminder of who jesse used to be and all that he lost all three flashbacks are also about the way that jesse has been forced by tragic circumstance to grow up and think more about his place in the universe and the impact he has on others and theyre about setting him on the road where ed galbraith leaves him at the films conclusion7 aaron paul described his character jesse as someone who went through hell and back multiple times and is still paying for those sins but donna bowman of the av club remarked that in freeing his ambitions from walter whites manipulations jesse found his own redemption and avoided his mentors fate finally giving himself a chance for a future1314 the opening flashback with jesse and mike also sets the theme of jesse wanting to start over while also making things right with his past though mike warned that starting over would make it impossible to make amends sepinwall noted that jesse was able to repay several emotional debts from the series with rectifying gestures throughout the film giving a proper goodbye to his friends badger and skinny pete apologizing to his parents one last time getting revenge against neil kandy and casey paying back his literal debt to ed galbraith and sending his farewell letter of apology to brock cantillo7 placing his own analysis on jesses final duel with neil gilligan interpreted the scene as more than just jesse getting the cash he needed for his escape but also as a way of exorcising demons that plagued him from the events of the series both gilligan and paul speculated that jesse would still be haunted by these demons even in his new life in alaska but had at least achieved some form of vengeance for his past by ridding the world of an evil person1213 breaking bad was often categorized as a contemporary western this theme is also present in el camino1516 gilligan expressed his admiration for director sergio leone and his love for the western genre he originally wanted to film breaking bad in the cinemascope format leone used for the dollars trilogy and got his wish in el camino217 critics noted the duel between jesse and neil as being directly in the style of western films1819 gilligan referenced the good the bad and the ugly and other classic gunfights to sequence the scene with comparable camera coverage techniques likewise composer dave porter used western elements in the scenes score2021 ben travers of indiewire traced the films western influences to its sweeping landscapes lone survivor and final standoff while matt zoller seitz of vulture called el caminos title unabashedly westerntinged and cited the final shots lack of overt sentimentality as being true to the spirit of classic westerns2223 productionedit conceptionedit vince gilligan the creator and showrunner of breaking bad had the idea for el camino while writing the series finale felina he asked himself what happened to jesse pinkman after the events of the episode when jesse escaped from the neonazis compound after being rescued by walter white17 though he kept jesses fate ambiguous in the finales script gilligan offered two possibilities during interviews a more realistic one where the police caught jesse a few miles from the compound and a second more optimistic one where he got away but still had to cope with the terrible things he witnessed throughout the series2425 in the intervening years gilligan toyed with both approaches one early idea involved jesse hiding close to the canadian border getting lured back into crime to help a young woman in the town this version ended with jesse in a jail cell in the concluding scene imprisoned yet at peace for the first time gilligans girlfriend holly rice advised against this ending saying fans would not appreciate seeing jesse incarcerated after all he had been through2627 he received the same feedback when separately pitching ideas for the film with the writing staff of better call saul a breaking bad spinoff also created by gilligan that still aired at the time the staff featured many writers from the original series gilligan originally served as coshowrunner during the early seasons before leaving the writers room to focus on other projects1728 they also objected to this ending because they planned on using a similar idea for the series finale of better call saul which was still to come many years later and felt this conclusion fit their story better than jesses29 after the negative reception to the concept of jesse getting caught by authorities gilligan subsequently went with the storyline of jesse escaping to alaska26 developmentedit el camino follows jesse pinkman portrayed by aaron paul after the events of breaking bad the original idea for continuing jesse pinkmans story began as a short film or miniepisode of about 15 to 20 minutes in length realizing a short would not be costeffective gilligan opted to make a fulllength feature film17 he initially thought about titling the project 63 referring to its unofficial status as the 63rd episode of breaking bad12 however during the meeting where gilligan pitched story ideas with the better call saul staff series executive producer thomas schnauz advised him to change this proposed title1712 schnauz who served as an executive producer and a writer on both television series reasoned to gilligan that breaking bad essentially focused on walter whites story whereas the film and its title should be unique to reflect that they centered on jesse pinkman3012 gilligan agreed and eventually settled on the title el camino referring to the car jesse drives away with in felina12 near the tenth anniversary of breaking bads premiere gilligan started sharing the idea with former cast and crew members as a means to celebrate the milestone2 aaron paul who portrayed jesse in the series affirmed that around this time he received a phone call from gilligan who hinted at a return for his character3132 paul initially believed this meant a cameo on better call saul which was a prequel to breaking bad gilligan then revealed his intentions to continue jesses story after the events of the series much to pauls excitement33 though he thought breaking bad concluded satisfyingly paul still felt attached to the character of jesse pinkman fans regularly asked him of jesses whereabouts while he occasionally wondered about jesses fate himself34 at the end of the conversation paul showed eagerness to be involved with any idea gilligan had for a breaking bad continuation31 gilligan presented paul with a completed screenplay seven months after proposing his idea35 paul spent three hours in gilligans office going over the script and almost instantly felt able to pick up on jesses mindset and emotional beats3436 following his initial readthrough paul was so impressed that he felt speechless and likened this initial reaction as being similar to the one after his first reading of felina3437 once he was finished with the screenplay paul continued to express happiness and excitement for the film which he called a love letter to jesse and breaking bads fans and lauded gilligan for approaching the script with caution and care3137 though gilligan had been involved with featurelength films before el camino would be the first he directed and produced2 while he considered the concept of a sequel film for an extended period after breaking bads conclusion gilligan stated he likely would not have been able to make it had better call saul been unsuccessful38 when gilligan made his initial film pitch to sony pictures television the studio behind both breaking bad and better call saul the executives in the room quickly agreed to come on board with his script in hand gilligan then selectively shopped the film to a few potential distributors settling on netflix and amc due to their history with the show gilligan intended for el camino to have a theatrical release which netflix previously provided for some of breaking bads season premieres el caminos unspecified budget surpassed the 6 million budget per episode by the end of the shows final season2 writingedit vince gilligan the creator and showrunner of breaking bad wrote and directed el camino unlike most of his work from the xfiles breaking bad and better call saul where he collaborated with a writers room to develop his scripts and meet his deadlines gilligan wrote the films screenplay alone until he felt it was ready to present regarding el camino as a coda to breaking bad gilligan believed the film would primarily appeal to fans and would not be as enjoyable to those who had not watched the series this influenced his decision to write it as a direct continuation rather than inserting exposition scenes to try to attract new viewers2 he felt el camino could be seen independently from both breaking bad and its spinoff better call saul similarly to how the two series could be seen independently from one another however he also believed the three works existed together in a larger framework and that viewers needed to watch all of them together to receive the full experience17 when thinking of which breaking bad characters to use for el camino gilligan considered bringing back skyler white walter jr hank and marie schrader and gus fring but could not find a way to incorporate them into jesses story saul goodman was also considered but gilligan desisted as he was unaware of the potential plans peter gould and the better call saul writers could have for the character in that series27 an early concept included bringing back uncle jack as a ghost that goaded jesse throughout his journey but gilligan discarded this idea as too dreary as he felt jesse already suffered enough17 of the characters he ended up using gilligan felt most excited to bring back the sociopathic todd alquist as he maintained fascination with the character and wished he could have been further explored on the series12 jesse plemons who portrayed todd expressed surprise at his deceased characters sizable role upon first reading the script and described his portion of the film as todd free from supervision of his elders having his best day3940 he also likened his scenes with jesse to a dark buddy comedy39 with todd and the rest of the neonazi gang canonically dead at the end of felina gilligan felt the film needed a new villain to introduce conflict for jesse in the present storyline for this reason gilligan created the character neil kandy the welder who gilligan labeled naziadjacent due to his prior business dealings with the gang he also described neil as being more sociopathic than todd saying it would take someone of neils caliber to create the dog run that physically tethered jesse without asking too many questions or even caring about jesses condition gilligan worried about introducing a new character not seen in breaking bad but also called it drama 101 to include neil as he gave jesse a villain he could prevail against and provided the film with more visceral flair17 peter gould and the better call saul writing staff regularly consulted gilligan as he developed the screenplay gilligan would keep the better call saul writers room involved throughout el caminos production including during the writing process41 this was to not only ensure the two projects continuity did not interfere with one another but to also take in suggestions to improve his screenplay upon completion of his first draft gilligan immediately sought the advice of gould who developed better call saul with gilligan and became its sole showrunner after gilligan reduced his own role in the series4228 the decision to bring jane margolis into the story resulted from this consultation as the initial script did not include the character after gould read the first draft he advised that jane could appear in the ending where it would mean the most to the audience gilligan thought about the suggestion for a couple of weeks and eventually agreed he incorporated the idea into his script and jane ultimately delivered the final lines of el camino1243 krysten ritter who reprised the role in the film called the ending with her character so beautiful as it sent jesse off into the sunset with jane riding shotgun he was going to be okay and she was there with him44 one of the biggest elements removed in later drafts was the very first thing gilligan wrote for the script the contents of jesses letter to brock45 gilligan planned on having it read in voiceover while jesse drove through alaska in the final scene paul described it as the most honest beautiful caring letter imaginable really just pouring his heart out and saying hes sorry46 while the better call saul staff praised the letters contents gould and several others felt it would be better left to the audiences imagination to determine what jesse wrote gilligan subsequently decided not to use the letter to conclude jesses story and the voiceover would never end up being recorded4147 paul agreed with gilligans decision but mentioned he felt crushed it did not appear in the final cut26 he retained possession of the letter after filming finished and shared his hopes that the letters contents will eventually be revealed to the public4746 gilligan wrote the scene of walter and jesse sitting in the diner in a lighthearted tone with the intention of providing one last chance to see the two characters together as a final treat for the fans producer melissa bernstein suggested adding a bit more poignancy to the scene to let it resonate further with the audience11 gilligan left most of the scene from the original script intact but he and bernstein came up with the line youre really lucky you know that that you didnt have to wait your whole life to do something special tying the scene to el caminos theme of jesse finally taking control of his life12 filmingedit under the working title greenbrier a majority of the filming occurred in albuquerque new mexico from november 2018 to february 2019 with the overall shoot lasting 50 days48492 el camino had a more relaxed shooting pace than breaking bad with only oneandahalf to three pages of script filmed per day as opposed to six to eight2 this lesspressured schedule gave the actors more opportunities to improvise on set while providing the crew members additional time to film a wider variety of shots and further camera coverage5051 gilligan felt the slower pace allowed him to reflect and feel a greater sense of finality for his creation whilst filming17 despite not portraying their characters since the shows ending several years prior cast members felt at ease reprising their former roles5253 paul filmed his scenes without any rehearsals as he felt he could easily access jesses emotions the same way he could on the series34 he likened his reprisal as jesse to zipping on an old friend54 el camino also used many of the crew members who held their roles since the pilot of breaking bad as several carried over to better call saul when the show concluded32 the first footage filmed for el camino was for the scene where jesse shows up at badger and skinny petes house and collapses into bed paul compared his first day of shooting with gilligan matt jones charles baker and the shows former crew members to a family reunion5556 during principal photography production nearly decided to forgo filming the shot of jesse picking up a beetle outside of neil kandys officen 8 citing scheduling constraints paul remained adamant in capturing the moment citing it as a key insight into jesses frame of mind the crew relented and filmed the scene in one take47 cinematographyedit el camino used a 239 widescreen aspect ratio on the arri alexa 65 camera to capture the work in a cinematic manner2 gilligan and cinematographer marshall adams specifically chose the alexa 65 for its quality in lowlight filming which the film heavily featured using this camera also meant el camino would be shot digitally as opposed to breaking bad which shot on 35 mm film57 production designer judy rhee noted that gilligan took advantage of his lens and wider aspect ratio to create a more visually luxurious experience than the series letting the wide vista shots help meet el caminos plot beats rather than employing more economic options commonly used for television58 adams agreed with this opinion citing as an example the vast and empty space of the painted desert underscoring jesses lonely and hopeless state in todds captivity59 gilligan wanted el caminos cinematography to maintain the naturalistic look used on breaking bad and better call saul while also expanding it adams specified this as the realistic practicaldriven looks for night exteriors and lowlight interiors that embraced all the colors and looks of albuquerque that he used on better call saul57 by combining the alexa 65 with arri prime dna lenses adams could capture lowlight efficiently control depth of field and also maintain color contrast and balance6057 adams graded el caminos color palette with davinci resolve he did not let breaking bad dictate which colors he used and opted to make a palette specific to the film to help receive dailies production used fotokem who did the same work on both breaking bad and better call saul the crew delivered footage with requested color changes to onsite fotokem members who then applied the changes to get the dailies out fairly quickly for adams review60 adams saw el camino as a way to pay homage to original breaking bad cinematographer michael slovis61 though adams took over as director of photography during the third season of better call saul he previously filmed pickups with slovis during the end of breaking bads fourth season and served as cinematographer during the shows fifth season premiere5759 for el camino adams took great lengths to match slovis lensing from the series while modifying it for the films digital format and larger aspect ratio6159 he specified the opening of jesse driving out of the compound as one scene he updated using this approach likening it to a direct cut from jesses last appearance in breaking bads finale adams applied the same principle for other scenes which used locations from the series such as the compound and the vacuum store59 to distinguish the flashback scenes from the ones set in the present gilligan decided against using different color saturation he instead chose to have flashbacks filmed in a handheld look while having the presentday scenes more anchored and locked down the fact that much of breaking bad used handheld filming inspired this decision59 with the alexa 65 camera too large to carry while filming gilligan achieved the wiggling effect by placing the camera on top of a truck airbag which could be inflated and deflated easily between two plastic plates60 set designedit filming primarily occurred at albuquerque studios where both breaking bad and better call saul were shot along with other locations throughout the city6257 wireless microphones would be planted throughout the sets and on the actors to record natural ambient noise and dialogue while shooting as gilligan preferred using organic sounds over applying adr during postproduction63 notable new sets built in the studio included todds apartment and the welding shop where jesses final confrontation with neil kandy and casey took place for the first rhee who worked as the production designer on better call sauls fourth season arranged the set to reflect the duality of todds character the initial living room seemed sunny meticulous and clean reflective of todds exterior boy scout personality and appeared decorated with a childlike easter egg palette to give a sense of his arrested development however the sets palette became darker going further into his bedroom indicative of todds sociopathic tendencies58 plemons likened the apartment set to looking inside todds brain describing absolute chaos beneath the apparent order on the surface64 rhee also designed the dimensions of the apartment set to fit el caminos aspect ratio when shooting overhead in doing this gilligan could create the shot of jesse searching for todds money in several different rooms simultaneously65 for the welding shop rhee wanted to maintain the accuracy of how a welding business appeared and match its exterior location but also designed the set for the scenes stunt choreography and necessary camera blocking rhee incorporated the glass office in the back of the set to include breakage during the climax and enhance the scenes action beats58 several breaking bad locations were reused for el camino such as the pinkman residence the strip mall that contained saul goodmans office and ed galbraiths vacuum repair shop66 the original vacuum store had sold and become a furniture store since the series ended so production had to recreate the set from scratch and use a special buyer to locate identical props from flea markets and salvage areas58 having a restored vacuum repair store set provided an added convenience for the fifth season premiere of better call saul which aired several months later initially the episode included ed galbraith simply as a voiceover as the episodes budget could not cover the cost of flying actor robert forster to albuquerque and rebuilding the vacuum shop set however bernstein recognized that both forster and the rebuilt set would be available as part of el camino she then arranged for gilligan to shoot the better call saul scene with forster in person during the films production months before filming began for any other episodes67 one major breaking bad location that had to be rebuilt primarily on stage was the compound that held jesse prisoner as many of the original structures had been torn down the new set recreated the interior of jesses cage for the initial scenes of jesse in captivity and seeing todd through the steel grate filming for the subsequent exterior sequence of todd letting jesse out of his confinement happened on location production found an existing quonset hut in downtown albuquerque and built a slightly smaller scale cage next to it in order to match the original site from the series65 for the rebuilt compound laboratory the set reused a majority of the original props notably the cooking vessel walter white touched shortly before he died in breaking bads final scene despite resulting in a continuity error gilligan said he did not have the heart to clean walts bloody handprint from the prop and instead left it in as an intentional easter egg for fans68 exterior locationsedit in addition to albuquerque filming locations included the painted desert in arizona left and around the grand tetons in wyoming right the enhanced budget and filming schedule provided gilligan a chance to capture scenes outside of new mexico something he wanted but could not do during breaking bad2 one such location included the painted desert in arizona where filming occurred for the scene of jesse and todd burying todds housekeeper12 gilligan had the idea of shooting in the region after multiple helicopter trips between california and albuquerque noting the landscape for its natural beauty as backroad travel in the painted desert required a permit gilligan received special permission from the navajo nation for filming27 paul and plemons reached the painted desert set by a helicopter flown by gilligan himself who was a licensed pilot69 the scene where todd sings sharing the night together in his el camino was also shot in the area gilligan noted that plemons improvised the gesture todd gives to the truck driver27 gilligan later referred to his time filming in the painted desert as the single best day of directing in his career70 another sequence filmed outside of albuquerque was the concluding scene of jesse driving towards his new life in haines alaska while gilligan wanted to use the haines highway to shoot on location production found that option expensive and instead used a similar setting outside of jackson wyoming during the day of filming the crew took advantage of low cloud to naturally hide the grand tetons in the background this allowed them to avoid using digital technology to remove the landmark in postproduction71 for the preceding scene of jesse making his final exchanges with ed galbraith in the parking lot outside of haines filming occurred at the sandia crest a ridgeline at the high point of the sandia mountains which overlooks albuquerque72 secrecyedit ive heard so many different things about it but i am excited about the breaking bad movie i find it hard to believe you dont know it was shot they did it you know what i mean how is that a secret but it is theyve done an amazing job of keeping it a secret bob odenkirk star of breaking bad spinoff better call saul speaking on el camino days before its announcement73 el camino was held in great secrecy from the preproduction stages certain cast members were approached for the film without knowing it was for a breaking bad continuation and some kept that fact secret from their families when production began7450 the producers were very protective of the script during this period cast and crew members needed to be physically present in front of them in order to read the one copy that was kept under lock and key7576 only near the start of shooting did rumors float that a breaking bad film began development with paul returning as jesse7778 bryan cranston who starred as walter white on the series confirmed the project in an interview but said he had not seen a script although he showed interest in participating if gilligan called for it79 bryan cranstons cameo as walter white was filmed in absolute secrecy during his twoday break from the broadway play network cranston would ultimately end up appearing in el camino having flown to albuquerque in a private jet to shoot his scenes within the span of 36 hours11 at the time he starred in the broadway production network a role for which he eventually won the tony award for best leading actor but used a twoday break in january for filming8081 as cranston had grown his hair out since the series ended the makeup team used a bald cap and fake moustache to help him achieve the appearance of walter white with additional visual effects added during postproduction to perfect his look8283 filming for the diner scene occurred first with the set containing only crew members and their families serving as extras in order to keep the shoot confidential80 despite the enclosed filming location numerous locals spotted the shows iconic rv in the parking lot of the diner but the crew used the excuse that they were shooting a commercial for a breaking bad tour to deflect attention12 cranston shot the hallway scene the next day then immediately returned to the airport arriving in new york in time to perform that same evening8083 to prevent paparazzi photos cranston heavily disguised himself when escorted from and throughout the set80 when filming completed for the day cranston and paul were told to avoid seeing each other56 similar measures were taken to ensure that news of filming did not reach the locals with cast and crew under tight restrictions about what they could say about the project2 cast members wore large cloaks to disguise their identities when heading to the set or when shooting outside in public places and each of their characters were given code names848586 when off the set the cast could not see one another and when recognized they would lie that they were working on the film568788 by the time the media began making a connection between greenbrier and breaking bad filming had mostly been completed31 after news broke that the film would be a breaking bad sequel representatives for amc netflix and sony pictures tv all declined to comment regarding the projects existence89 paul remained coy about its status claiming in an interview that he had not heard anything regarding a breaking bad movie even though filming had wrapped a month earlier90 filming of better call sauls fifth season took place shortly after el camino finished shooting to take advantage of the assembled crew as such cast members of better call saul became aware of the film but swore to secrecy on the project91 days before el caminos announcement bob odenkirk who starred as saul goodman on breaking bad and better call saul teased that the film was already completed and that the producers had done an amazing job of keeping it a secret73 editingedit editor skip macdonald who worked on breaking bad and better call saul stated that gilligan receiving more leeway in capturing the shots that he wanted during filming resulted in more interesting pieces and design shots during the editing process macdonald also felt the elongated production schedule provided him more time to work on the individual scenes and the films overall flow and described maintaining rhythm and pacing without the use of commercial breaks as one of the biggest differences between his work on the film and the two television series2092 gilligan waited until filming completed before entering the cutting room to provide feedback his initial viewing of macdonalds rough cut was his first time seeing any production footage edited together51 el caminos rough cut had an original runtime of three hours with an estimated 30 percent of footage left out of the finished film93 macdonald mentioned the necessity of excising scenes to sustain audience interest while also preventing the film from overextending its runtime92 one story development removed during postproduction involved jesse getting shot in the side during his final showdown with neil and casey17 this would have been followed by ed galbraith finding a wounded jesse at the vacuum store the following morning the latter subsequently opening his cars trunk to reveal the cash he acquired to fulfill his end of the bargain94 while paul asked to keep this sequence in the final cut gilligan felt it provided little payoff for the viewers and chose to remove it to let the film reach its conclusion quicker9572 other scenes shortened for runtime included jesse further relaxing in his hotel room before meeting with walter white and an extended sequence of jesse and jane during their road trip9697 gilligan confirmed the deleted and extended scenes would be available as bonus features for el caminos home video release17 musicedit scoreedit the breaking bad score is at times very very spare and i think the el camino score remains true to that but there is complexity and a depth to the music that is fuller and greater in order to fill more sonic space in a theater that was something we were definitely after dave porter el camino composer98 to arrange el caminos score production retained the use of composer dave porter who created all of the original music for breaking bad and better call saul9899 arriving later into the production process porter estimated spending six to eight weeks composing the score a much longer timetable compared to the three to four days per episode for the two series100101 given the lengthier production schedule gilligan appeared more frequently in the studio to listen to porters score and exchange ideas something he had never done during breaking bad76 porter in turn felt he had more resources to add nuance to el caminos music and worked with gilligan to achieve a cinematic sound which could also establish its own identity102 porter approached the film sequentially when composing the score a method he described as unique to his usual process103 he arranged the music in the beginning of the film to resemble that of an episode of breaking bad before gradually sounding unique to jesse104 similar to his work on both series his score used a mix of electronic sounds and live instrumentation21 when noting the biggest differences between scoring breaking bad and el camino porter mentioned that while the series shifted between multiple interwoven storylines the film focused on a singular arc the trials of jesse who he considered the moral thread of the series103104 this more linear storytelling presented porter the opportunity to further explore jesses state of mind and experiment with his sound104 he described el caminos contents and resulting score as more cerebral and psychological rather than relying on fastpaced adrenaline102 when preparing his score porter rewatched the series in order to select musical cues he could revisit for el camino many of the returning characters and locations received updated themes porter cited the scenes with ed galbraith and the compound as examples however to differentiate the flashback scenes from the scenes set in the present porter tried to replicate the less cinematic sounds from the original series as closely as possible he described his main goal in designing the films sound as wanting to link back to the score used in the series but in a manner that it would not feel jarring or out of place102 for this reason porter chose not to make any musical references to the original breaking bad theme song he felt it represented walter whites journey and did not fit in a story primarily about jesse105 mondo issued an official soundtrack on october 14 2020 nearly a full year after the films release the 26track doublelp featured porters score and many of el caminos licensed tracks106 licensed tracksedit licensed tracks were used sparingly in el camino98 two prominent in the final cut included sharing the night together by dr hook the medicine

uses a weighted average assigned el camino a score of 72 out of 100 based on 34 critics indicating generally favorable reviews155 judy berman of time lauded aaron pauls mesmerizing lead performance citing his ease at fully reinhabiting a role he hadnt played for years endowing jesse with the same mix of waning goofiness and escalating existential terror that propelled him through the finale156 liz shannon miller elaborated in her review from the verge that pauls work in el camino is staggering given the high difficulty factor that comes with having to play so many variations of this character and followed this by stating what makes el camino so compelling is the way it engages with how hes changed since those early days157 in contrast gqs david levesley felt el camino did not utilize pauls full potential saying that without actors to bounce off the film often doesnt know what to do with him158 daniel fienberg of the hollywood reporter would also highlight jesse plemons performance mentioning plemons never got the respect he deserved and this might be a good time to properly relish what an odd and awful guy todd was159 fienberg further commended vince gilligans direction calling gilligan a precise and complicated visual stylist the conception of breaking bad as a modern western has never been so clearly articulated and executed he also credited cinematographer marshall adams editor skip macdonald and composer dave porter all of whom worked on breaking bad and better call saul for helping el camino return to the original shows grammar159 writing for entertainment weekly critic darren franich called gilligans style energetic and lauded the larger budget being applied more for high anxiety than flashy pyrotechnics citing el caminos cinematography editing and montages as examples160 erik adams of the av club found the western imagery a bit clumsily deployed but complimented the scale of the film161 as a breaking bad continuationedit from a narrative perspective alan sepinwall of rolling stone praised el camino as a continuation of breaking bad stating that if the breaking bad conclusion had a flaw its that jesse got left behind a bit by the end of el camino thats no longer the case162 the daily beasts melissa leon agreed saying that breaking bad creator vince gilligans meditative neowestern el camino attaches a coda to jesses story detailing the emotional and physical scars walt left him to live with163 regarding the films chronology from the preceding series steve greene of indiewire commented though the specter of jesses former partners haunt el camino gilligan effectively holds the audiences attention to keep them focused on the present164 when comparing the film to other franchise continuation projects roxanne sancto of little white lies mentioned that movie spinoffs have become a dangerous trend that often ends in disappointment the balance needs to be just right and fortunately creator vince gilligan has nailed it with el camino165 while josh spiegel of film found el camino enjoyable he conversely saw the film as inessential to the overall arc of the series he wrote that if you loved breaking bad you might have wondered what will happen to jesse pinkman next its not even that vince gilligan answering that question was a bad idea its that a twohour version of that answer as beautiful as it looks and as wellacted as it is was wholly superfluous166 franich similarly compared el camino to a television reunion special calling it a playful project very fun not always necessary160 less complimentary was the bbcs hugh montgomery who described it as a franchise extension as lazy and vacuous as anything dreamt up on the bigscreen167 however alissa wilkinson of vox reasoned that the enjoyment of el camino comes from seeing your favorite characters again not finally resolving missing pieces that have tortured your sleep for six years168 brian tallerico of rogerebertcom also noted the necessity of having seen the entirety of breaking bad before watching the film writing that if youre hazy on what happened in the amc hit be warned that el camino does not hold your hand it is not designed to exist as a standalone movie as much as something watched after the end of season five169 richard roeper of chicago suntimes concurred saying youll be as lost as badger without skinny pete if you tried to watch this sharp and compelling sequel without having seen the series170 when speaking as to which audience would enjoy the film vadim rizov of sight sound remarked that el camino will only work for fans who can recall who all these familiar faces are the nostalgic pull and possibility for reconnection are sometimes recapped in dialogue most of it
