superlatively fresh metaphor for a middleage crisis it took cancer and lawbreaking to jolt walt out of his suburban stupor to experience life againto take chances risk danger do things he didnt think

hive mind with these wonderful writers where i dont remember who said what and it doesnt even matter whose idea was whose but i remember one afternoon somebody said and i was kind of into it for a while wouldnt it be really ironic if walt is the only one to survive this because it does seem so obvious that walt should expire at the end of the final episode but maybe hes the only one left alive maybe he still does have a death sentence but we go out on him alive and maybe his whole familys been wiped out that would have been really fing dark vince gilligan on an alternate ending185 variety held a qa with most of the original writing staff to reflect on the shows run the final season the writing process and alternative endings along with creator vince gilligan fellow writers and producers peter gould thomas schnauz gennifer hutchison moira walleybeckett sam catlin and george mastras joined to discuss memories from the shows humble beginnings character transformations that concluded in the final season as well as surprising developments along the way for instance jesses character was originally supposed to die halfway through season one in a tragic drug deal gone horribly wrong the reasoning behind this decision was that jesse served his purpose in a meatandpotatoes logistical sense the character would give walt his entrée into the business before meeting his demise however this was eventually done away with as the story progressed beyond gilligans early scripts185 the writers also opened up on their collaborative process and how their form of storytelling evolved with the show according to writer george mastras screen time was precious and infusing every moment with the emotion was the point not just forming the pieces of the puzzle to tell the story which is hard enough if youre going to take five seconds of screen time youd better damn well be sure that theres an emotion there it may be very very subtle but trust the audiences to pick up on that because audiences do185 the development of certain characters posed challenges skyler became unsympathetic to some viewers in earlier seasons as she was often presented as an obstacle to walts ultimate agenda the writers struggled to change the dynamic and realized that the only way people were going to like skyler was if she started going along with what walt was doing it was a tricky shift to alter on screen the writers did not want to betray her character this led them to justify the change by using her past job as a bookkeeper to segue into her helping walt launder his money breaking the individual episodes was another form of problemsolving for the writers they stressed the importance of not letting the master plan stop them from staying true to the world they created there came a point where tracking the characters on a momentbymoment basis proved to be more useful rather than the general direction of the story gould said they would always start with the last thought in a characters head wheres jesses head at that was always the prelude to the breakthrough moment because when you said that its usually because we had gotten attached to some big plan or some big setpiece that we thought had to be there but the characters didnt want to do what we wanted them to do185 audience response to skyleredit particular backlash was directed towards the character of skyler white it has sparked an ongoing dialog about a number of topics including societys attitude towards women feminism sexism and double standards186187 in august 2013 while breaking bad was in its original run anna gunn published an oped in the new york times titled i have a character issue in which she discussed her experience playing skyler with particular focus on the vitriol that audience members directed towards her character she compared skyler to similar television wives who seemed to inspire venom from audience members that their respective husbands did not in particular carmela soprano from the sopranos and betty draper from mad men in gunns words vince gilligan the creator of breaking bad wanted skyler to be a woman with a backbone of steel who would stand up to whatever came her way who wouldnt just collapse in the corner or wring her hands in despair he and the shows writers made skyler multilayered and in her own way morally compromised but at the end of the day she hasnt been judged by the same set of standards as walter188 in a 2018 cast reunion aaron paul commented why did our audience not sympathize with this poor woman i really felt for anna because shes just such a beautiful human inside and out and she played skyler in such a fierce way and people just dragged her character the most189 vince gilligan has defended both skyler and anna gunn saying at the same 2018 reunion i figured walt would be the one thatd be hard for people to sympathize with suddenly lo and behold were hearing this animus toward skyler white to this day it confounds me anna gunn gave such a brilliant performance we never tried for sympathy or lack of sympathy we let the chips fall where they may i would change that if i had a magic wand189 he later buttressed these sentiments in a 2022 interview adding i realize in hindsight that the show was rigged in the sense that the storytelling was solely through walts eyes even in scenes he wasnt present for even gus his archenemy didnt suffer the animosity skyler received its a weird thing im still thinking about it all these years later190 bryan cranston has also defended gunn and skyler saying if you look at the elements that were involved in thishusband she finds out is lying husband she finds out is doing something illegal is doing something that puts her family in lethal danger and shes being chastisedits like wait a minute it baffled me from an objective standpoint189 in 2018 gunn reflected on her experiences on the show saying this is not about me anna gunn and its really not about skyler its about the way people are connecting to him walter its also about the way that people still hold on to perhaps older ideas of what a woman or a wife should be or how she should act or how she should behave in the end change isnt always comfortable and isnt always pleasant but its good that it was brought to peoples attention and consciousness189 nearly a decade after the show ended gunn remarked that she saw an improvement as to how the character of skyler white was received as well as in the state of television actresses and female characters in general she said when people come up to me its incredibly different theres still a long way to go but we have made seismic changes since then so people come up to me now and say you were the linchpin for me you were the conscience of the show you were what pulled me into the show or they say the first time i watched it i hated that character but the second time i watched it i realized oh my god that poor woman191 rian johnsons experience on the showedit director rian johnson worked on three episodes fly fiftyone and ozymandias and in an interview with ign shared his memories from behind the camera he shed some light on the process including the fact that he sat through tone meetings with gilligan the two of them talked about every dramatic beat in a script the distinct visual look of the show and how the tonal shift of each scene had to feel natural while serving the main storyline of the particular episode johnson also revealed that he learned so much about working with actors because of his directing of cranston and paul describing the experience as a free masterclass192 when asked about the shows lasting legacy johnson offered up his thoughts i think the seriousness and depth with which it took its characters is the thing that really makes it stand apart for me and thats where the power of it comes from obviously starting with walter white theres just very few stories that are told on that scale that have a character who is that deeply considered at the center of it and ive heard people describe it as shakespearean and i know that word gets tossed around a lot but i think in this case it really does apply and that speaks not so much to the fact that he goes to a dark place but the fact that his entire journey is so deeply resonant because its so deeply considered192 franchiseedit main article
