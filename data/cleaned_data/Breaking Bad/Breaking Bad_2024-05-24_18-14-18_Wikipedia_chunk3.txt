david mattey as clarence man mountain who appears dropping off the women at kandy welding co themes and styleedit while el caminos plot focuses on jesse pinkman escaping to alaska writer and director vince gilligan stated that thematically the film centers on jesses transformation from a boy to a man as jesse spent the entirety of breaking bad as walter whites partner el camino in contrast shows jesse coming to terms with his past and making his own decisions free of whites influence12 this theme is prevalent in the flashbacks that bookend el camino with mike ehrmantraut at the beginning and walter white and jane margolis at the end alan sepinwall of rolling stone detailed that while these scenes serve as a reminder of who jesse used to be and all that he lost all three flashbacks are also about the way that jesse has been forced by tragic circumstance to grow up and think more about his place in the universe and the impact he has on others and theyre about setting him on the road where ed galbraith leaves him at the films conclusion7 aaron paul described his character jesse as someone who went through hell and back multiple times and is still paying for those sins but donna bowman of the av club remarked that in freeing his ambitions from walter whites manipulations jesse found his own redemption and avoided his mentors fate finally giving himself a chance for a future1314 the opening flashback with jesse and mike also sets the theme of jesse wanting to start over while also making things right with his past though mike warned that starting over would make it impossible to make amends sepinwall noted that jesse was able to repay several emotional debts from the series with rectifying gestures throughout the film giving a proper goodbye to his friends badger and skinny pete apologizing to his parents one last time getting revenge against neil kandy and casey paying back his literal debt to ed galbraith and sending his farewell letter of apology to brock cantillo7 placing his own analysis on jesses final duel with neil gilligan interpreted the scene as more than just jesse getting the cash he needed for his escape but also as a way of exorcising demons that plagued him from the events of the series both gilligan and paul speculated that jesse would still be haunted by these demons even in his new life in alaska but had at least achieved some form of vengeance for his past by ridding the world of an evil person1213 breaking bad was often categorized as a contemporary western this theme is also present in el camino1516 gilligan expressed his admiration for director sergio leone and his love for the western genre he originally wanted to film breaking bad in the cinemascope format leone used for the dollars trilogy and got his wish in el camino217 critics noted the duel between jesse and neil as being directly in the style of western films1819 gilligan referenced the good the bad and the ugly and other classic gunfights to sequence the scene with comparable camera coverage techniques likewise composer dave porter used western elements in the scenes score2021 ben travers of indiewire traced the films western influences to its sweeping landscapes lone survivor and final standoff while matt zoller seitz of vulture called el caminos title unabashedly westerntinged and cited the final shots lack of overt sentimentality as being true to the spirit of classic westerns2223 productionedit conceptionedit vince gilligan the creator and showrunner of breaking bad had the idea for el camino while writing the series finale felina he asked himself what happened to jesse pinkman after the events of the episode when jesse escaped from the neonazis compound after being rescued by walter white17 though he kept jesses fate ambiguous in the finales script gilligan offered two possibilities during interviews a more realistic one where the police caught jesse a few miles from the compound and a second more optimistic one where he got away but still had to cope with the terrible things he witnessed throughout the series2425 in the intervening years gilligan toyed with both approaches one early idea involved jesse hiding close to the canadian border getting lured back into crime to help a young woman in the town this version ended with jesse in a jail cell in the concluding scene imprisoned yet at peace for the first time gilligans girlfriend holly rice advised against this ending saying fans would not appreciate seeing jesse incarcerated after all he had been through2627 he received the same feedback when separately pitching ideas for the film with the writing staff of better call saul a breaking bad spinoff also created by gilligan that still aired at the time the staff featured many writers from the original series gilligan originally served as coshowrunner during the early seasons before leaving the writers room to focus on other projects1728 they also objected to this ending because they planned on using a similar idea for the series finale of better call saul which was still to come many years later and felt this conclusion fit their story better than jesses29 after the negative reception to the concept of jesse getting caught by authorities gilligan subsequently went with the storyline of jesse escaping to alaska26 developmentedit el camino follows jesse pinkman portrayed by aaron paul after the events of breaking bad the original idea for continuing jesse pinkmans story began as a short film or miniepisode of about 15 to 20 minutes in length realizing a short would not be costeffective gilligan opted to make a fulllength feature film17 he initially thought about titling the project 63 referring to its unofficial status as the 63rd episode of breaking bad12 however during the meeting where gilligan pitched story ideas with the better call saul staff series executive producer thomas schnauz advised him to change this proposed title1712 schnauz who served as an executive producer and a writer on both television series reasoned to gilligan that breaking bad essentially focused on walter whites story whereas the film and its title should be unique to reflect that they centered on jesse pinkman3012 gilligan agreed and eventually settled on the title el camino referring to the car jesse drives away with in felina12 near the tenth anniversary of breaking bads premiere gilligan started sharing the idea with former cast and crew members as a means to celebrate the milestone2 aaron paul who portrayed jesse in
