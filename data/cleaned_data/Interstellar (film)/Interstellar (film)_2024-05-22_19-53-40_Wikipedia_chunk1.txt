travel through a wormhole near saturn in search of a new home for humankind brothers christopher and jonathan nolan wrote the screenplay which had its origins in a script jonathan developed in 2007 and was originally set to be directed by steven spielberg kip thorne a caltech theoretical physicist was an executive producer acted as a scientific consultant and wrote a tiein book the science of interstellar cinematographer hoyte van hoytema shot it on 35 mm movie film in the panavision anamorphic format and imax 70 mm principal photography began in late 2013 and took place in alberta iceland and los angeles interstellar uses extensive practical and miniature effects and the company dneg created additional digital effects interstellar premiered in los angeles on october 26 2014 in the united states it was first released on film stock expanding to venues using digital projectors the film received positive reviews from critics and grossed over 681 million worldwide 733 million after subsequent rereleases making it the tenthhighestgrossing film of 2014 it has been praised by astronomers for its scientific accuracy and portrayal of theoretical astrophysics456 interstellar was nominated for five awards at the 87th academy awards winning best visual effects and received numerous other accolades plotedit in 2067 humanity is facing extinction following a global famine caused by ecocide7 joseph cooper a former nasa test pilot along with his son and daughter tom and murph and fatherinlaw donald are farmers like most of humanity one evening during a dust storm cooper and murph discover a gravitational anomaly in murphs bedroom that has left patterns of falling particles the pattern leads them to a secret nasa facility where cooper gets enlisted by the lead scientist brand as the pilot of their latest mission which will take them beyond the galaxy in search of new habitable planets this can now be achieved via a mysterious wormhole another anomaly near saturn leading to a faraway planetary system orbiting gargantua a supermassive black hole cooper struggles to leave his children behind but decides to do it in the hope of saving tom and murphs generation from extinction he promises murph to return but she is distraught cooper joins the endurance team consisting of romilly doyle and brands daughter amelia and two intelligent robots tars and case after years of travel the crew enters the wormhole and arrives at the first candidate planet in the new galaxy only to find that it is an ocean world with massive tidal waves caused by gargantuas intense gravitational pull doyle is swept away and killed by a wave cooper and amelia narrowly survive but are delayed returning to the endurance due to time dilation 23 years have passed onboard and on earth during their absence from the craft on earth in 2092 an adult murph helps brand with his perennially unsolved gravity manipulation equation which is supposed to help transport humanity en masse to potentially habitable worlds on his deathbed brand confesses that the equation was a charade meant to keep humans from dissolving into anarchy out of panic for their eventual doom murph is frustrated and wonders if cooper knowingly abandoned her she decides to continue his work and returns to her childhood home to search for clues on the second candidate planet the endurance crew is met by a harsh ice world they awaken mann the surviving nasa explorer in cryostasis who landed here a decade ago mann and cooper go on a scouting trip but once alone mann confesses that the planet is uninhabitable and that he falsified data to attract rescuers he tries to kill cooper but fails amelia is pulled into rescuing cooper leading romilly to die at the base by an explosive trap left by mann mann takes off in a lander attempting to hijack the endurance but is killed by a failed docking maneuver cooper and amelia chase down the damaged spacecraft and narrowly dock with it though they have limited fuel remaining and are falling into the black hole charting a gravityassist path around gargantua cooper propels the craft towards the third and final planet causing another 51 years to dilate ignoring amelias protestations he detaches the two heavy auxiliary craft carrying himself and tars so that amelias massreduced craft may safely reach the final planet beyond the black holes event horizon cooper falls into a fourdimensional tesseract where time is a physical dimension he uses gravity to communicate with murph and his past self and realizes he sent the nasa coordinates to himself thereby initiating this mission he deduces that a future generation created the tesseract to similarly guide humankind cooper eventually enables murph to solve the gravity equation by sending her the quantum data captured by tars inside the singularity murph comes across the information encoded in coopers wristwatch which she finds while visiting the family home she saves humanity by successfully developing gravity manipulation the tesseract dissolves ejecting cooper and tars back into saturns orbit where they are rescued in 2156 by humans inside a massive oneill cylinder named after murph when he finally reunites with his daughter who is now relatively much older than him she tells him not to wait around for her to die and to seek out amelia instead cooper commandeers a spacecraft and sets off on another solo mission with tars meanwhile on the final candidate planet amelia sets up a new colony with the help of robots she surveys the landscape and removes her helmet

mary zophres costume designer lee smith editor hans zimmer music composer paul franklin visual effects supervisor kip thorne consultant executive producer development and financingedit the premise for interstellar was conceived by the producer lynda obst and the theoretical physicist kip thorne who collaborated on the film contact 1997 and had known each other since carl sagan set them up on a blind date89 the two conceived a scenario based on thornes work about the most exotic events in the universe suddenly becoming accessible to humans and attracted steven spielbergs interest in directing10 the film began development in june 2006 when spielberg and paramount pictures announced plans for a sciencefiction film based on an eightpage treatment written by obst and thorne obst was attached to produce1112 by march 2007 jonathan nolan was hired to write a screenplay13 after spielberg moved his production studio dreamworks from paramount to walt disney studios in 2009 paramount needed a new director for interstellar jonathan nolan recommended his brother christopher who joined the project in 201214 christopher nolan met with thorne then attached as executive producer to discuss the use of spacetime in the story15 in january 2013 paramount and warner bros announced that christopher nolan was in negotiations to direct interstellar16 nolan said he wanted to encourage the goal of human spaceflight17 and intended to merge his brothers screenplay with his own18 by the following march nolan was confirmed to direct interstellar which would be produced under his label syncopy and lynda obst productions19 the hollywood reporter said nolan would earn a salary of 20 million against 20 of the total gross20 to research for the film nolan visited nasa and the private space program at spacex15 warner bros sought a stake in nolans production of interstellar from paramount despite their traditional rivalry and agreed to give paramount its rights to cofinance the next film in the friday the 13th horror franchise with a stake in a future film based on the television series south park warner bros also agreed to let paramount cofinance an indeterminate alist property21 in august 2013 legendary pictures finalized an agreement with warner bros to finance approximately 25 of the films production although it failed to renew its eightyear production partnership with warner bros legendary reportedly agreed to forgo financing batman v superman dawn of justice 2016 in exchange for the stake in interstellar22 writing and castingedit the dust bowl phenomenon of the 1930s as documented by ken burns in the dust bowl 2012 served as inspiration for the blight jonathan nolan worked on the script for four years8 to learn the scientific aspects he studied relativity at the california institute of technology23 he was pessimistic about the space shuttle program ending and how nasa lacked financing for a human mission to mars drawing inspiration from sciencefiction films with apocalyptic themes such as walle 2008 and avatar 2009 jeff jensen of entertainment weekly said he set the story in a dystopian future ravaged by blight but populated with hardy folk who refuse to bow to despair14 his brother christopher had worked on other science fiction scripts but decided to take the interstellar script and choose among the vast array of ideas presented by jonathan and thorne he picked what he felt as director he could get across to the audience and hopefully not lose them before he merged it with a script he had worked on for years on his own1524 christopher kept in place jonathans conception of the first hour which is set on a resource depleted earth in the near future the setting was inspired by the dust bowl that took place in the united states during the great depression in the 1930s8 he revised the rest of the script where a team travels into space instead8 after watching the 2012 documentary the dust bowl for inspiration christopher contacted the director ken burns and the producer dayton duncan they granted him permission to use some of their featured interviews in interstellar25 christopher nolan wanted an actor who could bring to life his vision of the main character as an everyman with whom the audience could experience the story26 he became interested in casting matthew mcconaughey after watching him in an early cut of the 2012 film mud26 which he had seen as a friend of one of its producers aaron ryder8 nolan went to visit mcconaughey while he was filming for the tv series true detective27 anne hathaway was invited to nolans home where she read the script for interstellar28 in early 2013 both actors were cast in the starring roles29 jessica chastain was contacted while she was working on miss julie 2014 in northern ireland and a script was delivered to her28 originally irrfan khan was offered the role of dr mann but rejected it due to scheduling conflicts matt damon was cast as mann in late august 2013 and completed filming his scenes in iceland30 principal photographyedit nolan shot interstellar on 35 mm film in the panavision anamorphic format and imax 70 mm photography31 cinematographer hoyte van hoytema was hired for interstellar as wally pfister nolans cinematographer on all of his previous films was making his directorial debut working on transcendence 201432 pfister would later retire as a cinematographer for films33 more imax cameras were used for interstellar than for any of nolans previous films to minimize the use of computergenerated imagery cgi nolan had practical locations built such as the interior of a space shuttle26 van hoytema retooled an imax camera to be handheld for shooting interior scenes8 some of the films sequences were shot with an imax camera installed in the nose cone of a learjet34 nolan who is known for keeping details of his productions secret strove to ensure secrecy for interstellar writing for the wall street journal ben fritz stated the famously secretive filmmaker has gone to extreme lengths to guard the script to interstellar just as he did with the blockbuster dark knight trilogy35 as one security measure interstellar was filmed under the name floras letter36 flora being one of nolans four children with producer emma thomas15 the svínafellsjökull glacier in iceland was used as a filming location for interstellar doubling for manns planet the films principal photography was scheduled to last four months30 it began on august 6 2013 in the province of alberta canada22 towns in alberta where shooting took place included nanton longview lethbridge fort macleod and okotoks in okotoks filming took place at the seaman stadium and the olde town plaza36 for a cornfield scene production designer nathan crowley planted 500 acres 200 ha of corn that would be destroyed in an apocalyptic dust storm scene14 intended to be similar to storms experienced during the dust bowl in 1930s america15 additional scenes involving the dust storm and mcconaugheys character were also shot in fort macleod where the giant dust clouds were created on location using large fans to blow cellulosebased synthetic dust through the air37 filming in the province lasted until september 9 2013 and involved hundreds of extras in addition to 130 crew members most of whom were local36 shooting also took place in iceland where nolan had previously filmed scenes for batman begins 200538 it was chosen to represent two extraterrestrial planets one covered in ice and the other in water8 the crew transported mock spaceships weighing about 10000 pounds 4500 kg15 they spent two weeks shooting there30 during which a crew of about 350 people including 130 locals worked on the film locations included the svínafellsjökull glacier and the town of klaustur3940 while filming a water scene in iceland hathaway almost suffered hypothermia because her dry suit had not been properly secured15 after the schedule in iceland was completed the crew shot in los angeles for 54 days filming locations included the westin bonaventure hotel and suites the los angeles convention center a sony pictures soundstage in culver city and a private residence in altadena california41 principal photography concluded in december 201342 production had a budget of 165 million 10 million less than was allotted by paramount warner bros and legendary pictures15 production designedit the endurance spacecraft left is based on the international space station right interstellar features three spacecraft the endurance a ranger and a lander the endurance the crews mother ship is a circular structure consisting of 12 capsules laid flat to mimic a clock four capsules with planetary settling equipment four with engines and four with the permanent functions of cockpit medical labs and habitation production designer nathan crowley said the endurance was based on the international space station its a real mishmash of different kinds of technology you need analogue stuff as well as digital stuff you need backup systems and tangible switches its really like a submarine in space every inch of space is used everything has a purpose the rangers function is similar to the space shuttles being able to enter and exit planetary atmospheres lastly the lander transports the capsules with settling equipment to planetary surfaces crowley compared it to a heavy russian helicopter8 the film features two robots case and tars as well as a dismantled third robot kipp nolan wanted to avoid making the robots anthropomorphic and chose a 15 m 49 ft quadrilateral design he said it has a very complicated design philosophy its based on mathematics youve got four main blocks and they can be joined in three ways so you have three combinations you follow but then within that it subdivides into a further three joints and all the places we see linesthose can subdivide further so you can unfold a finger essentially but its all proportional bill irwin voiced and physically controlled both robots with his image digitally removed and josh stewart replaced his voicing for case8 the human space habitats resemble oneill cylinders a theoretical space habitat model proposed by physicist gerard k oneill in 197643 sound designedit gregg landaker and gary rizzo were the films audio engineers tasked with audio mixing while sound editor richard king supervised the process44 christopher nolan sought to mix the sound to take maximum advantage of theater equipment45 and paid close attention to designing the sound mix like focusing on the sound of buttons being pressed with astronaut suit gloves14 the studios website stated that the film was mixed to maximize the power of the lowend frequencies in the main channels as well as in the subwoofer channel46 nolan deliberately intended some dialogue to seem drowned out by ambient noise or music causing some theaters to post notices emphasizing that this effect was intentional and not a fault in their equipment47 musicedit main article interstellar soundtrack hans zimmer who scored nolans the dark knight trilogy and inception 2010 returned to score interstellar nolan chose not to provide zimmer with a script or any plot details but instead gave him a single page that told the story of a father leaving his child for work it was through this connection that zimmer created the early stages of the interstellar soundtrack zimmer and nolan later decided the 1926 fourmanual harrison harrison organ of the temple church london would be the primary instrument for the score4849 zimmer conducted 45 scoring sessions for interstellar three times more than for inception the soundtrack was released on november 18 201414 visual effectsedit the visual effects company double negative which worked on inception was brought back for interstellar50 according to visual effects supervisor paul franklin the number of effects in the film was not much greater than in nolans the dark knight rises 2012 or inception however for interstellar they created the effects first allowing digital projectors to display them behind the actors rather than having the actors perform in front of green screens8 the film contained 850 visualeffect shots at a resolution of 5600 4000 lines 150 shots that were created incamera using digital projectors and another 700 were created in postproduction of those 620 were presented in imax while the rest were anamorphic51 the ranger endurance and lander spacecraft were created using miniature effects by nathan crowley in collaboration with effects company new deal studios as opposed to using computergenerated imagery as nolan felt they offered the best way to give the ships a tangible presence in space 3dprinted and handsculpted the scale models earned the nickname maxatures by the crew due to their immense size the 115thscale miniature of the endurance module spanned over 76 m 25 ft while a pyrotechnic model of part of the craft was built at 15th scale the ranger and lander miniatures spanned 14 m 46 ft and over 15 m 49 ft respectively and were large enough for van hoytema to mount imax cameras directly onto the spacecraft thus mimicking the look of nasa imax documentaries the models were then attached to a sixaxis gimbal on a motion control system that allowed an operator to manipulate their movements which were filmed against background plates of space using vistavision cameras on a smaller motion control rig52 new deal studios miniatures were used in 150 special effects shots51 influencesedit nolan was influenced by what he called key touchstones of science fiction cinema including metropolis 1927 2001 a space odyssey 1968 blade runner 198253 star wars 1977 and alien 197954 andrei tarkovskys the mirror 1975 influenced elemental things in the story to do with wind and dust and water according to nolan55 who also compared interstellar to the treasure of the sierra madre 1948 as a film about human nature56 he sought to emulate films like steven spielbergs jaws 1975 and close encounters of the third kind 1977 for being familyfriendly but also as edgy and incisive and challenging as anything else on the blockbuster spectrum he screened the right stuff 1983 for the crew before production8 following in its example by capturing reflections on the interstellar astronauts visors for further inspiration nolan invited former astronaut marsha ivins to the set15 nolan and his crew studied the imax nasa documentaries of filmmaker toni myers for visual reference of spacefaring missions and strove to imitate their use of imax cameras in the enclosed spaces of spacecraft interiors57 clark kents upbringing in man of steel 2013 was the inspiration for the farm setting in the midwest24 apart from the films nolan drew inspiration from the architecture of ludwig mies van der rohe15 scientific accuracyedit kip thorne a theoretical physicist and nobel laureate served as scientific consultant and executive producer regarding the concepts of wormholes and black holes kip thorne said he worked on the equations that would enable tracing of light rays as they traveled through a wormhole or around a black holeso what you see is based on einsteins general relativity equations58 early in the process thorne laid down two guidelines first that nothing would violate established physical laws second that all the wild speculations would spring from science and not from the fertile mind of a screenwriter nolan accepted these terms as long as they did not get in the way of making the film12 at one point thorne spent two weeks arguing nolan out of having a character traveling faster than light before nolan finally gave up59 according to thorne the element that has the highest degree of artistic freedom is the clouds of ice on one of the planets they visit which are structures that would go beyond the material strength that ice could support12 the astrobiologist david grinspoon criticized the dire blight situation on earth portrayed in the early scenes pointing out that even with a voracious blight it would have taken millions of years to reduce the atmospheres oxygen content he also notes that gravity should have pulled down the ice clouds60 neil degrasse tyson an astrophysicist explored the science behind the ending of interstellar concluding that it is theoretically
