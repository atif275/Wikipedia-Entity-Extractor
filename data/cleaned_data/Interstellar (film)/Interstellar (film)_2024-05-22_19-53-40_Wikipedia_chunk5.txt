and hokey and not as visionary as its cuttingedge special effects and at nearly three hours the film would have benefited from more judicious editing the associated press jake coyle said that at its heart interstellar is a fatherdaughter tale grandly spun across a cosmic tapestry he continued there is turbulence along the way interstellar is overly explanatory about its physics its dialogue can be clunky and you may want to send composer hans zimmers relentless organ into deep space but if you take these for blips rather than black holes the majesty of interstellar is something to behold for the washington posts ann hornaday the film didnt quite come together she said that there are moments of genuine awe and majesty in interstellar but there are just as many passages that play as if nolan is less interested in value for the viewers than proving a point whether about the arcana of quantum physics his technical prowess or the enduring power of love mcconaughey makes for a compelling even believable hero she continued but too often the fatherdaughter dynamics that propel interstellar feel shrewdly calculated the emotionalism ginned up to a hysterically maudlin pitch ultimately the film tries so hard to be so many things that it winds up shrinking into itself much like one of the collapsed stars mcconaugheys character hurtles past on his way to new worlds and the boston globes ty burr wrote theres only so much you can pile on the pie plate before it starts spilling rhubarb on the floor the parts of interstellar that dont work struggle against the many parts that do nolan is one of the few working filmmakers with the skill set to take us far beyond our normal moviegoing orbit but his vision keeps coming up against the curves of the known pop universe hes the showman who fancies himself a philosopher oliver gettell interstellar is an ambitious imperfect scifi epic reviews say las angeles times nov 5 2014 the movies you grow up with the culture you absorb through the decades become part of your expectations while watching a film so you cant make any film in a vacuum were making a sciencefiction film you cant pretend 2001 doesnt exist when youre making interstellar i grew up in an era that was the golden age of blockbusters with films like close encounters and the way that addressed the idea of this moment when humans would meet aliens from a family perspective and a very relatable human perspective i liked the idea of trying to give todays audiences some sense of that form of storyline christopher nolan as quoted in interstellar q a nolan set out to make modernday close encounters by matt mueller at thompson on hollywood 29 october 2014 i think really space exploration to me has always represented the most hopeful and optimistic endeavor that mankind has ever really engaged with i was certainly struck when they flew the space shuttle in the 747 when it came to the science center here in la were up in griffith park with hundreds of people waving flags and watching this thing fly down and it was a very moving moment actually and a little melancholy at the same time because what we felt was that sense of that great endeavor that great collective endeavor the hope and optimism of that is something it feels like were in need of again i feel very strongly that were at a point now where we need to start looking out again and exploring our place in the universe more i had the advantage of coming to the project late being able to look at what these guys had done and a lot of my contribution was stripping things down because they put in all these incredible mindblowing ideas but i felt that it was more than i could absorb as an audience member so i spent a lot of time in my work on the script kind of choosing what i thought were the most emotive the most tactile of these ideas things i could really grab a hold of then i found working with kip to be very liberating because it wasnt so much restraint of well science says you cant do this it was more an exploration of ideas with him of ok whats plausible we could go here we could go there i found it very exciting to work with him on that i dont like to talk about messages so much with films simply because its a little more didactic the reason im a filmmaker is to tell stories and so you hope that they will have resonance for people and for the kind of things youre talking about but what i always loved about jonahs original draft and we always retained this was the idea of blight the idea of there being an agricultural crisis which has happened historically if you look at the potato famine and so forth we combined this with ideas taken very much from ken burns documentary on the dust bowl and spoke to ken at great length and availed ourselves of his resources because what struck me about the dust bowl is it was manmade environmental crisis but one where the imagery the effect of it was so outlandish we actually had to tone it down for what we put in the film but the real point is theyre nonspecific that were saying that in our story mankind is being gently nudged off the planet by the earth itself and the reason is nonspecific because we dont want to be too didactic or too political about it thats not really the point for me it goes back to something emma said earlier which was that my excitement about the project was addressing a possibly extremely negative idea in terms of the planet having had enough of us and suggesting that we go somewhere else but that being an opportunity that being a great exciting adventure to be on was something i found very winning about it christopher nolan in christopher nolan matthew mcconaughey anne hathaway and more talk interstellar the evolution of the script and grounding the film with emotion by steve frosty weintraub collider november 8 2014 its very straightforward selfishness and cowardice its very human and i love what matt did with that he found the reality of it its the kind of sequence where you loathe the guy because hes doing something that you feel you might wind up doing in a similar situation its very logical but the rationalization of it is extraordinary the way he was able to rationalize his own cowardice into a positive thing loneliness and desperation will make us do crazy things mann is not exactly crazy its weirdly logical but appallingly selfish the only outcome to the mission for him was a colony i think and its something we talked a lot about and its something he says in the film that there was no doubt in his mind that his was going to be the planet his was going to be the mission so whatever the risks he felt very confident and when hes confronted by the bleak reality of just dying out there alone it all starts to unravel christopher nolan as quoted in christopher nolan talks interstellar ending and that big thirdact twist in film by angie han 21 november 2014 the inception of the project for me began in 2006 or 2007 that was when i first started thinking about it and i was struck in that moment by what felt for a variety of reasons felt like to be growing up in this age to be growing up in this country in this moment in time theres a line about this in the film it feels like every day is christmas theres some remarkable technology theres some remarkable thing you get to a certain moment where you realize all those humans who landed on the moon did so in between chris being born and me being born and no one had gone back since all these super8 films we grew up watching of rocket launches you get to a certain age and you realize all the speeches about going back theyre speeches theres no money there were not going back and that moment it felt like the melancholy or the sadness of that was to imagine as a species that we might have peaked that if you charted our evolution as a species in terms of altitude we peaked in 1973 that was kind of a sad realization growing up youre promised jet packs and we got instagram kind of a bum deal i think so i was rooted in the optimism of what is the next moment in which we start to journey again jonathan nolan in christopher nolan matthew

landscapes are deployed in service of hallmark card homilies about how people should live and whats really important we love people who have diedwhats the social utility in that accident is the first step in evolution after a certain point it sinks in or should sink in that nolan and his coscreenwriter brother jonathan nolan arent trying to oneup the spectacular rationalism of 2001 the movies science fiction trappings are just a wrapping for a spiritualemotional dream about basic human desires for home for family for continuity of bloodline and culture as well as for a horror film of sortsone that treats the star voyagers and their earthbound loved ones separation as spectacular metaphors for what happens when the people we value are taken from us by death illness or unbridgeable distance pray you never learn just how good it can be to see another face another astronaut says after years alone in an interstellar wilderness while interstellar never entirely commits to the idea of a nonrational uncanny world it nevertheless has a mystical strain one thats unusually pronounced for a director whose storytelling has the rightbrained sensibility of an engineer logician or accountant theres a ghost in this film writing out messages to the living in dust characters strain to interpret distant radio messages as if they were ancient texts written in a dead language and stare through redrimmed eyes at video messages sent years ago by people on the other side of the cosmos interstellar features a family haunted by the memory of a dead mother and then an absent father a woman haunted by the memory of a missing father and another woman whos separated from her own dad and mentor and driven to reunite with a lover separated from her by so many millions of miles that he might as well be dead the films widescreen panoramas feature harsh interplanetary landscapes shot in cruel earth locales some of the largest and most detailed starship miniatures ever built and space sequences presented in scientifically accurate silence a la 2001 but for all its hightech glitz interstellar has a defiantly oldmovie feeling its not afraid to switch even lurch between modes at times the movies onestopshopping storytelling evokes the toughtender spirit of a john ford picture or a steven spielberg film made in the spirit of a ford picture a movie that would rather try to be eight or nine things than just one bruising outerspace action sequences with astronauts tumbling in zero gravity and striding across forbidding landscapes give way to snappy comic patter mostly between cooper and the ships robot tars designed in minecraftstyle pixelish boxes and voiced by bill irwin there are long explanatory sequences done with and without dry erase boards dazzling vistas that are less spaces than mindspaces and tearful separations and reconciliations that might as well be played silent in tinted blackandwhite and scored with a saloon piano spielberg originated interstellar in 2006 but dropped out to direct other projects mcconaughey a superintense actor who wholeheartedly commits to every line and moment hes given is the right leading man for this kind of film cooper proudly identifies himself as an engineer as well as an astronaut and farmer but he has the soul of a goofball poet when he stares at intergalactic vistas he grins like a kid at an amusement park waiting to ride a new roller coaster coopers farewell to his daughter murphwhos played by mckenzie foy as a young girlis shot very closein and lit in warm cradling tones it has some of the tenderness of the porch swing scene in to kill a mockingbird when murph grows up into jessica chastaina key member of caines nasa crew and a surrogate for the daughter that the elder brand lost to the endurances missionwe keep thinking about that goodbye scene and how its anguish drives everything that murph and cooper are trying to do while also realizing that similar feelings drive the other charactersindeed the rest of the species one suspects this is a deeply personal film for nolan its about a man who feels he has been called to a particular job and whose work requires him to spend long periods away from his family matt zoller seitz interstellar rogerebertcom november 3 2014 external linksedit wikipedia wikipedia has an article about interstellar film commons wikimedia commons
