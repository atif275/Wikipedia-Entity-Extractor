possible to interact with the past and that we dont really know whats in a black hole so take it and run with it61 the theoretical physicist michio kaku praised the film for its scientific accuracy and said interstellar could set the gold standard for science fiction movies for years to come timothy reyes a former nasa software engineer said thornes and nolans accounting of black holes and wormholes and the use of gravity is excellent62 mathematical physicist ikjyot singh kohli first published an article on the blog63 defending the physics used in the film in particular he provided calculations in which he showed that the time dilation effect caused by the spinning black hole in the movie was indeed accurate the article was written shortly after the films release in response to a number of scientific blogs that criticized the films physics for not being accurate which were shown by kohli to be due to several misunderstandings by the authors of the blogs in question64 wormholes and black holesedit millers planet orbiting gargantua to create the visual effects for the wormhole and a rotating supermassive black hole possessing an ergosphere as opposed to a nonrotating black hole thorne collaborated with franklin and a team of 30 people at double negative providing pages of deeply sourced theoretical equations to the engineers who then wrote new cgi rendering software based on these equations to create accurate simulations of the gravitational lensing caused by these phenomena some individual frames took up to 100 hours to render totaling 800 terabytes of data9 thorne described the accretion disk of the black hole as anemic and at low temperature65about the temperature of the surface of the sun allowing it to emit appreciable light but not enough gamma radiation and xrays to threaten nearby astronauts and planets66 the resulting visual effects provided thorne with new insight into the gravitational lensing and accretion disks surrounding black holes resulting in the publication of three scientific papers676869 the first image of the event horizon of a black hole obtained by the event horizon telescope the asymmetric brightness of the accretion disk is well visible here nolan was initially concerned that a scientifically accurate depiction of a black hole would not be visually comprehensible to an audience and would require the effects team to unrealistically alter its appearance the visual representation of the black hole in the film does not account for the doppler effect which when added by the visual effects team resulted in an asymmetrically lit black and blueblack hole the purpose of which nolan thought the audience would not understand as a result it was omitted in the finished product70 nolan found the finished effect to be understandable as long as he maintained consistent camera perspectives71 as a reference the asymmetric brightness of the accretion disk is very well visible in the first image72 of the event horizon of a black hole obtained by the event horizon telescope team in 2019 futurasciences praised the correct depiction of the penrose process73 according to spacecom the portrayal of what a wormhole would look like is scientifically correct rather than a twodimensional hole in space it is depicted as a sphere showing a distorted view of the target galaxy74

responseedit on review aggregator rotten tomatoes 73 of 378 critic reviews are positive with an average of 7110 the sites critics consensus reads interstellar represents more of the thrilling thoughtprovoking and visually resplendent filmmaking moviegoers have come to expect from writerdirector christopher nolan even if its intellectual reach somewhat exceeds its grasp154 metacritic assigned the film a score of 74 out of 100 based on 46 critics indicating generally favorable reviews155 audiences polled by cinemascore gave it an average grade of b on an a to f scale156 scott foundas chief film critic at variety said that interstellar is as visually and conceptually audacious as anything nolan has yet done and considered the film more personal than nolans previous films157 claudia puig of usa today praised the visual spectacle and powerful themes while criticizing the dull dialogue and tedious patches inside the space vessel158 david stratton of at the movies rated the film fourandahalf stars out of five commending its ambition effects and 70 mm imax presentation though criticizing the sound for being so loud as to make some of the dialogue inaudible conversely cohost margaret pomeranz rated the film three out of five as she felt the human drama got lost among the films scientific concepts159 henry barnes of the guardian scored the film three out of five stars calling it a glorious spectacle but a slight drama with few characters and toorare flashes of humour160 james berardinelli called interstellar an amazing achievement and simultaneously a bigbudget science fiction endeavor and a very simple tale of love and sacrifice it is by turns edgy breathtaking hopeful and heartbreaking161 he named it the best film of 2014162 and the secondbest movie of the decade deeming it a real science fiction rather than the crowdpleasing watereddown version hollywood typically offers163 its been a while since somebody has come out with such a big vision to things even the elements the fact that dust is everywhere and theyre living in this dust bowl that is just completely enveloping this area of the world thats almost something you expect from tarkovsky or malick not a science fiction adventure movie164 quentin tarantino on interstellar oliver gettell of the los angeles times reported that film critics largely agree that interstellar is an entertaining emotional and thoughtprovoking scifi saga even if it can also be clunky and sentimental at times165 james dyer of empire awarded the film a full five stars describing it as brainy barmy and beautiful to behold a mindbending opera of space and time with a soul wrapped up in all the science166 dave calhoun of time out london also granted the film a maximum score of five stars stating that it is a bold beautiful cosmic adventure story with a touch of the surreal and the dreamlike167 richard roeper of chicago suntimes awarded the film a full four stars and wrote this is one of the most beautiful films i have ever seenin terms of its visuals and its overriding message about the powerful forces of the one thing we all know but cant measure in scientific terms love168 describing nolan as a merchant of awe tim robey of the telegraph thought that interstellar was agonisingly close to a masterpiece highlighting the conceptual boldness and deepdigging intelligence of the film169 todd mccarthy of the hollywood reporter wrote this grandly conceived and executed epic tries to give equal weight to intimate human emotions and speculation about the cosmos with mixed results but is never less than engrossing and sometimes more than that170 in his review for the associated press jake coyle praised the film for its bigscreen grandeur while finding some of the dialogue clunky he described it further as an absurd endeavor and one of the most sublime movies of the decade171 scott mendelson of forbes listed interstellar as one of the most disappointing films of 2014 stating that the film has a lack of flow loss of momentum following the climax clumsy sound mixing and thin characters despite seeing the film twice in order to give it a second chance he wrote that interstellar ends up as a strippeddown and somewhat muted variation on any number of go into space to save the world movies172 matt zoller seitz of rogerebertcom gave the film threeandahalf out of four stars saying that despite his usual quibbles regarding nolans excessive dialogue and its lack of a sense of composition interstellar is still an impressive at times astonishing movie that overwhelmed me to the point where my usual objections to nolans work melted away at times the movies onestopshopping storytelling evokes the toughtender spirit of a john ford picture a movie that would rather try to be eight or nine things than just one173 new york times columnist david brooks concludes that interstellar explores the relationships among science and faith and science and the humanities and illustrates the real symbiosis between these realms174 mark steyn commented on the technological future and the focus on the fatherdaughter relationship175 wai chee dimock in the los angeles review of books wrote that nolans films are rotatable at 90 180 and 360 degrees and that although there is considerable magical thinking here making it almost an antiscifi film holding out hope that the end of the planet is not the end of everything it reverses itself however when that magic falls short when the poetic license is naked and plain for all to see176 author george r r martin called interstellar
