bankrupted themselves pouring resources into rockets and other useless machines cooper useless machines ms hanley and if we dont want to repeat of the excess and wastefulness of the 20th century then we need to teach our kids about this planet not tales of leaving it cooper you know one of those useless machines they used to make was called an mri and if we had one of those left the doctors would have been able to find the cyst in my wifes brain before she died instead of afterwards and then she wouldve been the one sitting here listening to this instead of me which wouldve been a good thing

this planets time she landed here just hours ago she might have died only minutes ago case the data doyle collected was just the initial status echoing endlessly cooper were not prepared for this brand youre a bunch of eggheads without the survival skills of a boyscout troop brand we got this far on our brains farther than any humans in history cooper no not far enough and were stuck here till

john lithgow donald coopers fatherinlaw leah cairns lois cooper toms wife quotes about interstellaredit i grew up in an era that was the golden age of blockbusters with films like close encounters and the way that addressed the idea of this moment when humans would meet aliens from a family perspective and a very relatable human perspective i liked the idea of trying to give todays audiences some sense of that form of storyline christopher nolan the times kenneth turan gave a glowing review writing that though its a big studio blockbuster with all the traditional plot elements the term implies interstellar turns out to be the rarest beast in the hollywood jungle its a mass audience picture thats intelligent as well as epic with a sophisticated script thats as interested in emotional moments as immersive visuals which is saying a lot the new york times ao scott wrote it may be enough to say that interstellar is a terrifically entertaining sciencefiction movie giving fresh life to scenes and situations weve seen a hundred times before and occasionally stumbling over pompous dialogue or overly portentous music usa todays claudia puig was more measured in her appraisal writing while it reaches for the stars director christopher nolans interstellar is a flawed masterpiece the story is everambitious sometimes riveting and thoughtprovoking but also plodding
