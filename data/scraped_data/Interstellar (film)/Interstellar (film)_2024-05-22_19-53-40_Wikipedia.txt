Interstellar is a 2014 epic science fiction drama film directed, written, and produced by Christopher Nolan and starring Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, Bill Irwin, Ellen Burstyn, Michael Caine, and Matt Damon. Set in a dystopian future where humanity is embroiled in a catastrophic blight and famine, the film follows a group of astronauts who travel through a wormhole near Saturn in search of a new home for humankind.
Brothers Christopher and Jonathan Nolan wrote the screenplay, which had its origins in a script Jonathan developed in 2007 and was originally set to be directed by Steven Spielberg. Kip Thorne, a Caltech theoretical physicist was an executive producer, acted as a scientific consultant, and wrote a tie-in book, The Science of Interstellar. Cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema shot it on 35 mm movie film in the Panavision anamorphic format and IMAX 70 mm. Principal photography began in late 2013 and took place in Alberta, Iceland, and Los Angeles. Interstellar uses extensive practical and miniature effects, and the company DNEG created additional digital effects.
Interstellar premiered in Los Angeles on October 26, 2014. In the United States, it was first released on film stock, expanding to venues using digital projectors. The film received positive reviews from critics and grossed over $681 million worldwide ($733 million after subsequent re-releases), making it the tenth-highest-grossing film of 2014. It has been praised by astronomers for its scientific accuracy and portrayal of theoretical astrophysics.[4][5][6] Interstellar was nominated for five awards at the 87th Academy Awards, winning Best Visual Effects, and received numerous other accolades.


Plot[edit]
In 2067, humanity is facing extinction following a global famine caused by ecocide.[7] Joseph Cooper, a former NASA test pilot, along with his son and daughter, Tom and Murph, and father-in-law Donald, are farmers, like most of humanity. One evening, during a dust storm, Cooper and Murph discover a gravitational anomaly in Murph's bedroom that has left patterns of falling particles. The pattern leads them to a secret NASA facility, where Cooper gets enlisted by the lead scientist, Brand, as the pilot of their latest mission, which will take them beyond the galaxy in search of new habitable planets. This can now be achieved via a mysterious wormhole − another anomaly − near Saturn, leading to a faraway planetary system orbiting Gargantua, a supermassive black hole. 
Cooper struggles to leave his children behind, but decides to do it in the hope of saving Tom and Murph's generation from extinction. He promises Murph to return, but she is distraught. Cooper joins the Endurance team, consisting of Romilly, Doyle, and Brand's daughter Amelia − and two intelligent robots, TARS and CASE. After years of travel, the crew enters the wormhole and arrives at the first candidate planet in the new galaxy, only to find that it is an ocean world with massive tidal waves caused by Gargantua's intense gravitational pull. Doyle is swept away and killed by a wave. Cooper and Amelia narrowly survive, but are delayed returning to the Endurance. Due to time dilation, 23 years have passed onboard and on Earth during their absence from the craft. On Earth in 2092, an adult Murph helps Brand with his perennially unsolved gravity manipulation equation, which is supposed to help transport humanity en masse to potentially habitable worlds. 
On his deathbed, Brand confesses that the equation was a charade, meant to keep humans from dissolving into anarchy out of panic for their eventual doom. Murph is frustrated and wonders if Cooper knowingly abandoned her. She decides to continue his work, and returns to her childhood home to search for clues. On the second candidate planet, the Endurance crew is met by a harsh ice world. They awaken Mann, the surviving NASA explorer in cryostasis, who landed here a decade ago. Mann and Cooper go on a scouting trip, but once alone, Mann confesses that the planet is uninhabitable and that he falsified data to attract rescuers. He tries to kill Cooper but fails. Amelia is pulled into rescuing Cooper, leading Romilly to die at the base by an explosive trap left by Mann. Mann takes off in a lander, attempting to hijack the Endurance, but is killed by a failed docking maneuver. Cooper and Amelia chase down the damaged spacecraft, and narrowly dock with it though they have limited fuel remaining and are falling into the black hole. 
Charting a gravity-assist path around Gargantua, Cooper propels the craft towards the third and final planet, causing another 51 years to dilate. Ignoring Amelia's protestations, he detaches the two heavy auxiliary craft carrying himself and TARS so that Amelia's mass-reduced craft may safely reach the final planet. Beyond the black hole's event horizon, Cooper falls into a four-dimensional tesseract, where time is a physical dimension. He uses gravity to communicate with Murph and his past self, and realizes he sent the NASA coordinates to himself, thereby initiating this mission. He deduces that a future generation created the tesseract to similarly guide humankind. Cooper eventually enables Murph to solve the gravity equation by sending her the quantum data captured by TARS inside the singularity. Murph comes across the information encoded in Cooper's wristwatch, which she finds while visiting the family home. She saves humanity by successfully developing gravity manipulation. The tesseract dissolves, ejecting Cooper and TARS back into Saturn's orbit, where they are rescued in 2156 by humans inside a massive O'Neill cylinder named after Murph. When he finally reunites with his daughter, who is now relatively much older than him, she tells him not to wait around for her to die and to seek out Amelia instead. Cooper commandeers a spacecraft and sets off on another solo mission with TARS. 
Meanwhile, on the final candidate planet, Amelia sets up a new colony with the help of robots. She surveys the landscape and removes her helmet, breathing in the air of the new habitable world.

Development and financing[edit]
The premise for Interstellar was conceived by the producer Lynda Obst and the theoretical physicist Kip Thorne, who collaborated on the film Contact (1997), and had known each other since Carl Sagan set them up on a blind date.[8][9] The two conceived a scenario, based on Thorne's work, about "the most exotic events in the universe suddenly becoming accessible to humans", and attracted Steven Spielberg's interest in directing.[10] The film began development in June 2006, when Spielberg and Paramount Pictures announced plans for a science-fiction film based on an eight-page treatment written by Obst and Thorne. Obst was attached to produce.[11][12] By March 2007, Jonathan Nolan was hired to write a screenplay.[13]
After Spielberg moved his production studio, DreamWorks, from Paramount to Walt Disney Studios in 2009, Paramount needed a new director for Interstellar. Jonathan Nolan recommended his brother Christopher, who joined the project in 2012.[14] Christopher Nolan met with Thorne, then attached as executive producer, to discuss the use of spacetime in the story.[15] In January 2013, Paramount and Warner Bros. announced that Christopher Nolan was in negotiations to direct Interstellar.[16] Nolan said he wanted to encourage the goal of human spaceflight,[17] and intended to merge his brother's screenplay with his own.[18] By the following March, Nolan was confirmed to direct Interstellar, which would be produced under his label Syncopy and Lynda Obst Productions.[19] The Hollywood Reporter said Nolan would earn a salary of $20 million against 20% of the total gross.[20] To research for the film, Nolan visited NASA and the private space program at SpaceX.[15]
Warner Bros. sought a stake in Nolan's production of Interstellar from Paramount, despite their traditional rivalry, and agreed to give Paramount its rights to co-finance the next film in the Friday the 13th horror franchise, with a stake in a future film based on the television series South Park. Warner Bros. also agreed to let Paramount co-finance an indeterminate "A-list" property.[21] In August 2013, Legendary Pictures finalized an agreement with Warner Bros. to finance approximately 25% of the film's production. Although it failed to renew its eight-year production partnership with Warner Bros., Legendary reportedly agreed to forgo financing Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016) in exchange for the stake in Interstellar.[22]

Writing and casting[edit]
The Dust Bowl phenomenon of the 1930s, as documented by Ken Burns in The Dust Bowl (2012), served as inspiration for the blight.
Jonathan Nolan worked on the script for four years.[8] To learn the scientific aspects, he studied relativity at the California Institute of Technology.[23] He was pessimistic about the Space Shuttle program ending and how NASA lacked financing for a human mission to Mars, drawing inspiration from science-fiction films with apocalyptic themes, such as WALL-E (2008) and Avatar (2009). Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly said: "He set the story in a dystopian future ravaged by blight, but populated with hardy folk who refuse to bow to despair."[14] His brother Christopher had worked on other science fiction scripts but decided to take the Interstellar script and choose among the vast array of ideas presented by Jonathan and Thorne. He picked what he felt, as director, he could get "across to the audience and hopefully not lose them," before he merged it with a script he had worked on for years on his own.[15][24] Christopher kept in place Jonathan's conception of the first hour, which is set on a resource depleted Earth in the near future. The setting was inspired by the Dust Bowl that took place in the United States during the Great Depression in the 1930s.[8] He revised the rest of the script, where a team travels into space, instead.[8] After watching the 2012 documentary The Dust Bowl for inspiration, Christopher contacted the director, Ken Burns, and the producer, Dayton Duncan. They granted him permission to use some of their featured interviews in Interstellar.[25]
Christopher Nolan wanted an actor who could bring to life his vision of the main character as an everyman with whom "the audience could experience the story."[26] He became interested in casting Matthew McConaughey after watching him in an early cut of the 2012 film Mud,[26] which he had seen as a friend of one of its producers, Aaron Ryder.[8] Nolan went to visit McConaughey while he was filming for the TV series True Detective.[27] Anne Hathaway was invited to Nolan's home, where she read the script for Interstellar.[28] In early 2013, both actors were cast in the starring roles.[29] Jessica Chastain was contacted while she was working on Miss Julie (2014) in Northern Ireland, and a script was delivered to her.[28] Originally, Irrfan Khan was offered the role of Dr. Mann but rejected it due to scheduling conflicts. Matt Damon was cast as Mann in late August 2013 and completed filming his scenes in Iceland.[30]

Principal photography[edit]
Nolan shot Interstellar on 35 mm film in the Panavision anamorphic format and IMAX 70 mm photography.[31] Cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema was hired for Interstellar, as Wally Pfister, Nolan's cinematographer on all of his previous films, was making his directorial debut working on Transcendence (2014);[32] Pfister would later retire as a cinematographer for films.[33]
More IMAX cameras were used for Interstellar than for any of Nolan's previous films. To minimize the use of computer-generated imagery (CGI), Nolan had practical locations built, such as the interior of a space shuttle.[26] Van Hoytema retooled an IMAX camera to be hand-held for shooting interior scenes.[8] Some of the film's sequences were shot with an IMAX camera installed in the nose cone of a Learjet.[34]
Nolan, who is known for keeping details of his productions secret, strove to ensure secrecy for Interstellar. Writing for The Wall Street Journal, Ben Fritz stated, "The famously secretive filmmaker has gone to extreme lengths to guard the script to ... Interstellar, just as he did with the blockbuster Dark Knight trilogy."[35] As one security measure, Interstellar was filmed under the name Flora's Letter,[36] Flora being one of Nolan's four children with producer Emma Thomas.[15]

The Svínafellsjökull glacier in Iceland was used as a filming location for Interstellar, doubling for Mann's planet.
The film's principal photography was scheduled to last four months.[30] It began on August 6, 2013, in the province of Alberta, Canada.[22] Towns in Alberta where shooting took place included Nanton, Longview, Lethbridge, Fort Macleod, and Okotoks. In Okotoks, filming took place at the Seaman Stadium and the Olde Town Plaza.[36] For a cornfield scene, production designer Nathan Crowley planted 500 acres (200 ha) of corn that would be destroyed in an apocalyptic dust storm scene,[14] intended to be similar to storms experienced during the Dust Bowl in 1930s America.[15] Additional scenes involving the dust storm and McConaughey's character were also shot in Fort Macleod, where the giant dust clouds were created on location using large fans to blow cellulose-based synthetic dust through the air.[37] Filming in the province lasted until September 9, 2013, and involved hundreds of extras in addition to 130 crew members, most of whom were local.[36]
Shooting also took place in Iceland, where Nolan had previously filmed scenes for Batman Begins (2005).[38] It was chosen to represent two extraterrestrial planets: one covered in ice, and the other in water.[8] The crew transported mock spaceships weighing about 10,000 pounds (4,500 kg).[15] They spent two weeks shooting there,[30] during which a crew of about 350 people, including 130 locals, worked on the film. Locations included the Svínafellsjökull glacier and the town of Klaustur.[39][40] While filming a water scene in Iceland, Hathaway almost suffered hypothermia because her dry suit had not been properly secured.[15]
After the schedule in Iceland was completed, the crew shot in Los Angeles for 54 days. Filming locations included the Westin Bonaventure Hotel and Suites, the Los Angeles Convention Center, a Sony Pictures soundstage in Culver City, and a private residence in Altadena, California.[41] Principal photography concluded in December 2013.[42] Production had a budget of $165 million, $10 million less than was allotted by Paramount, Warner Bros., and Legendary Pictures.[15]

Production design[edit]
The Endurance spacecraft (left) is based on the International Space Station (right).
Interstellar features three spacecraft— the Endurance, a ranger, and a lander. The Endurance, the crew's mother ship, is a circular structure consisting of 12 capsules, laid flat to mimic a clock: Four capsules with planetary settling equipment, four with engines, and four with the permanent functions of cockpit, medical labs, and habitation. Production designer Nathan Crowley said the Endurance was based on the International Space Station: "It's a real mish-mash of different kinds of technology. You need analogue stuff, as well as digital stuff, you need backup systems and tangible switches. It's really like a submarine in space. Every inch of space is used, everything has a purpose." The ranger's function is similar to the Space Shuttle's, being able to enter and exit planetary atmospheres. Lastly, the lander transports the capsules with settling equipment to planetary surfaces. Crowley compared it to "a heavy Russian helicopter."[8]
The film features two robots, CASE and TARS, as well as a dismantled third robot, KIPP. Nolan wanted to avoid making the robots anthropomorphic and chose a 1.5 m (4.9 ft) quadrilateral design. He said: "It has a very complicated design philosophy. It's based on mathematics. You've got four main blocks and they can be joined in three ways. So, you have three combinations you follow. But then within that, it subdivides into a further three joints. And all the places we see lines—those can subdivide further. So you can unfold a finger, essentially, but it's all proportional." Bill Irwin voiced and physically controlled both robots, with his image digitally removed, and Josh Stewart replaced his voicing for CASE.[8] The human space habitats resemble O'Neill cylinders, a theoretical space habitat model proposed by physicist Gerard K. O'Neill in 1976.[43]

Sound design[edit]
Gregg Landaker and Gary Rizzo were the film's audio engineers tasked with audio mixing, while sound editor Richard King supervised the process.[44] Christopher Nolan sought to mix the sound to take maximum advantage of theater equipment[45] and paid close attention to designing the sound mix, like focusing on the sound of buttons being pressed with astronaut suit gloves.[14] The studio's website stated that the film was "mixed to maximize the power of the low-end frequencies in the main channels, as well as in the subwoofer channel."[46] Nolan deliberately intended some dialogue to seem drowned out by ambient noise or music, causing some theaters to post notices emphasizing that this effect was intentional and not a fault in their equipment.[47]

Music[edit]
Main article: Interstellar (soundtrack)
Hans Zimmer, who scored Nolan's The Dark Knight Trilogy and Inception (2010), returned to score Interstellar. Nolan chose not to provide Zimmer with a script or any plot details but instead gave him a single page that told the story of a father leaving his child for work. It was through this connection that Zimmer created the early stages of the Interstellar soundtrack. Zimmer and Nolan later decided the 1926 four-manual Harrison & Harrison organ of the Temple Church, London, would be the primary instrument for the score.[48][49] Zimmer conducted 45 scoring sessions for Interstellar, three times more than for Inception. The soundtrack was released on November 18, 2014.[14]

Visual effects[edit]
The visual effects company Double Negative, which worked on Inception, was brought back for Interstellar.[50] According to visual effects supervisor Paul Franklin, the number of effects in the film was not much greater than in Nolan's The Dark Knight Rises (2012) or Inception. However, for Interstellar, they created the effects first, allowing digital projectors to display them behind the actors, rather than having the actors perform in front of green screens.[8] The film contained 850 visual-effect shots at a resolution of 5600 × 4000 lines: 150 shots that were created in-camera using digital projectors, and another 700 were created in post-production. Of those, 620 were presented in IMAX, while the rest were anamorphic.[51]
The ranger, Endurance, and lander spacecraft were created using miniature effects by Nathan Crowley in collaboration with effects company New Deal Studios, as opposed to using computer-generated imagery, as Nolan felt they offered the best way to give the ships a tangible presence in space. 3D-printed and hand-sculpted, the scale models earned the nickname "maxatures" by the crew due to their immense size; the 1/15th-scale miniature of the Endurance module spanned over 7.6 m (25 ft), while a pyrotechnic model of part of the craft was built at 1/5th scale. The Ranger and Lander miniatures spanned 14 m (46 ft) and over 15 m (49 ft), respectively, and were large enough for van Hoytema to mount IMAX cameras directly onto the spacecraft, thus mimicking the look of NASA IMAX documentaries. The models were then attached to a six-axis gimbal on a motion control system that allowed an operator to manipulate their movements, which were filmed against background plates of space using VistaVision cameras on a smaller motion control rig.[52] New Deal Studio's miniatures were used in 150 special effects shots.[51]

Influences[edit]
Nolan was influenced by what he called "key touchstones" of science fiction cinema, including Metropolis (1927), 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), Blade Runner (1982),[53] Star Wars (1977), and Alien (1979).[54] Andrei Tarkovsky's The Mirror (1975) influenced "elemental things in the story to do with wind and dust and water", according to Nolan,[55] who also compared Interstellar to The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (1948) as a film about human nature.[56] He sought to emulate films like Steven Spielberg's Jaws (1975) and Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977) for being family-friendly but also "as edgy and incisive and challenging as anything else on the blockbuster spectrum". He screened The Right Stuff (1983) for the crew before production,[8] following in its example by capturing reflections on the Interstellar astronauts' visors. For further inspiration, Nolan invited former astronaut Marsha Ivins to the set.[15] Nolan and his crew studied the IMAX NASA documentaries of filmmaker Toni Myers for visual reference of spacefaring missions, and strove to imitate their use of IMAX cameras in the enclosed spaces of spacecraft interiors.[57] Clark Kent's upbringing in Man of Steel (2013) was the inspiration for the farm setting in the Midwest.[24] Apart from the films, Nolan drew inspiration from the architecture of Ludwig Mies van der Rohe.[15]

Scientific accuracy[edit]
Kip Thorne, a theoretical physicist and Nobel Laureate, served as scientific consultant and executive producer.
Regarding the concepts of wormholes and black holes, Kip Thorne said he "worked on the equations that would enable tracing of light rays as they traveled through a wormhole or around a black hole—so what you see is based on Einstein's general relativity equations".[58] Early in the process, Thorne laid down two guidelines: "First, that nothing would violate established physical laws. Second, that all the wild speculations ... would spring from science and not from the fertile mind of a screenwriter." Nolan accepted these terms as long as they did not get in the way of making the film.[12] At one point, Thorne spent two weeks arguing Nolan out of having a character traveling faster than light before Nolan finally gave up.[59] According to Thorne, the element that has the highest degree of artistic freedom is the clouds of ice on one of the planets they visit, which are structures that would go beyond the material strength that ice could support.[12]
The astrobiologist David Grinspoon criticized the dire "blight" situation on Earth portrayed in the early scenes, pointing out that even with a voracious blight it would have taken millions of years to reduce the atmosphere's oxygen content. He also notes that gravity should have pulled down the ice clouds.[60] Neil deGrasse Tyson, an astrophysicist, explored the science behind the ending of Interstellar, concluding that it is theoretically possible to interact with the past, and that "we don't really know what's in a black hole, so take it and run with it".[61] The theoretical physicist Michio Kaku praised the film for its scientific accuracy and said Interstellar "could set the gold standard for science fiction movies for years to come". Timothy Reyes, a former NASA software engineer, said "Thorne's and Nolan's accounting of black holes and wormholes and the use of gravity is excellent".[62]
Mathematical Physicist Ikjyot Singh Kohli first published an article on the blog[63] defending the physics used in the film. In particular, he provided calculations in which he showed that the time dilation effect caused by the spinning black hole in the movie was indeed accurate. The article was written shortly after the film's release in response to a number of scientific blogs that criticized the film's physics for not being accurate, which were shown by Kohli to be due to several misunderstandings by the authors of the blogs in question.[64]

Wormholes and black holes[edit]
Miller's planet orbiting Gargantua
To create the visual effects for the wormhole and a rotating, supermassive black hole (possessing an ergosphere, as opposed to a non-rotating black hole), Thorne collaborated with Franklin and a team of 30 people at Double Negative, providing pages of deeply sourced theoretical equations to the engineers, who then wrote new CGI rendering software based on these equations to create accurate simulations of the gravitational lensing caused by these phenomena. Some individual frames took up to 100 hours to render, totaling 800 terabytes of data.[9] Thorne described the accretion disk of the black hole as "anemic and at low temperature[65]—about the temperature of the surface of the sun," allowing it to emit appreciable light, but not enough gamma radiation and X-rays to threaten nearby astronauts and planets.[66] The resulting visual effects provided Thorne with new insight into the gravitational lensing and accretion disks surrounding black holes, resulting in the publication of three scientific papers.[67][68][69]

The first image of the event horizon of a black hole, obtained by the Event Horizon Telescope. The asymmetric brightness of the accretion disk is well visible here.
Nolan was initially concerned that a scientifically accurate depiction of a black hole would not be visually comprehensible to an audience, and would require the effects team to unrealistically alter its appearance. The visual representation of the black hole in the film does not account for the Doppler effect which, when added by the visual effects team, resulted in an asymmetrically lit black and blue-black hole, the purpose of which Nolan thought the audience would not understand. As a result, it was omitted in the finished product.[70] Nolan found the finished effect to be understandable, as long as he maintained consistent camera perspectives.[71]
As a reference, the asymmetric brightness of the accretion disk is very well visible in the first image[72] of the event horizon of a black hole obtained by the Event Horizon Telescope team in 2019. Futura-Sciences praised the correct depiction of the Penrose process.[73]
According to Space.com, the portrayal of what a wormhole would look like is scientifically correct. Rather than a two-dimensional hole in space, it is depicted as a sphere, showing a distorted view of the target galaxy.[74]

Marketing[edit]
The teaser trailer for Interstellar debuted December 13, 2013, and featured clips related to space exploration, accompanied by a voiceover by Matthew McConaughey's character, Cooper.[75] The theatrical trailer debuted May 5, 2014, at the Lockheed Martin IMAX Theater in Washington, D.C., and was made available online later that month. For the week ending on May 19, it was the most-viewed film trailer, with over 19.5 million views on YouTube.[76]
Christopher Nolan and McConaughey made their first appearances at San Diego Comic-Con in July 2014 to promote Interstellar. That same month, Paramount Pictures launched an interactive website, on which users uncovered a star chart related to the Apollo 11 Moon landing.[77]
In October 2014, Paramount partnered with Google to promote Interstellar across multiple platforms.[78] The film's website was relaunched as a digital hub hosted on a Google domain,[79] which collected feedback from film audiences, and linked to a mobile app.[79] It featured a game in which players could build Solar System models and use a flight simulator for space travel.[80] The Paramount–Google partnership also included a virtual time capsule compiled with user-generated content, made available in 2015.[81] The initiative Google for Education used the film as a basis for promoting math and science lesson plans in schools.[78][82]
Paramount provided a virtual reality walkthrough of the Endurance spacecraft using Oculus Rift technology. It hosted the walkthrough sequentially in New York City, Houston, Los Angeles, and Washington, D.C., from October 6 through November 19, 2014.[83][84] The publisher Running Press released Interstellar: Beyond Time and Space, a book by Mark Cotta Vaz about the making of the film, on November 11.[85] W. W. Norton & Company released The Science of Interstellar, a book by Thorne;[86] Titan Books released the official novelization, written by Greg Keyes;[87] and Wired magazine released a tie-in online comic, Absolute Zero, written by Christopher Nolan and drawn by Sean Gordon Murphy. The comic is a prequel to the film, with Mann as the protagonist.[88]

Release[edit]
Theatrical[edit]
Before Interstellar's public release, Paramount CEO Brad Grey hosted a private screening on October 19, 2014, at the AMC Lincoln Square 13 IMAX theater in Manhattan, New York.[89][90] Paramount then showed Interstellar to some of the industry's filmmakers and actors in a first-look screening at the California Science Center on October 22.[91] On the following day, the film was screened at the TCL Chinese Theatre in Los Angeles, California for over 900 members of the Screen Actors Guild.[92] The film premiered on October 26 at the TCL Chinese Theatre in Los Angeles,[93] and in Europe on October 29 at the Odeon Leicester Square in London.[94][95]
Interstellar was released early on November 4 in various 70 mm IMAX film, 70 mm film and 35 mm film theaters, and had a limited release in North America on November 5, with a wide release on November 7.[96] The film was released in Belgium, France, and Switzerland on November 5, the UK on November 7 and in additional territories in the following days.[97] For the limited North American release, Interstellar was projected from 70 mm and 35 mm film in 249 theaters that still supported those formats, including at least forty-one 70 mm IMAX theaters. A 70 mm IMAX projector was installed at the TCL Chinese Theatre in Los Angeles to display the format. The film's wide release expanded to theaters that showed it digitally.[98] Paramount Pictures distributed the film in North America, and Warner Bros. distributed it in the remaining territories.[31] The film was released in over 770 IMAX screens worldwide, which was the largest global release in IMAX cinemas,[99][100] until surpassed by Universal Pictures' Furious 7 (2015) with 810 IMAX theaters.[101]
Interstellar was an exception to Paramount Pictures' goal to stop releasing films on film stock and to distribute them only in digital format.[102] According to Pamela McClintock of The Hollywood Reporter, the initiative to project Interstellar on film stock would help preserve an endangered format,[98] which was supported by Christopher Nolan, J. J. Abrams, Quentin Tarantino, Judd Apatow, Paul Thomas Anderson, and other filmmakers.[103] McClintock reported that theatre owners saw this as "backward," as nearly all theatres in the US had been converted to digital projection.[104]

Home media[edit]
Interstellar was released on home video on March 31, 2015, in both the United Kingdom and United States.[105] It topped the home video sales chart for a total of two weeks.[106][107] It was reported that Interstellar was the most pirated film of 2015, with an estimated 46.7 million downloads on BitTorrent.[108] It was released in the Ultra HD Blu-ray format on December 19, 2017.[109]

Interstellar grossed $188 million in the US and Canada, and $493 million in other countries, for a worldwide total of $681 million on original release, against a production budget of $165 million.[3] Deadline Hollywood calculated net profit to be $47 million, accounting for production budgets, marketing, talent participations, and other costs, with box office grosses, and ancillary revenues from home media, placing it 20th on their list of 2014's "Most Valuable Blockbusters".[110] It sold an estimated 22 million tickets domestically.[111]
The film set an IMAX opening record worldwide with $20.5 million from 574 IMAX theaters, surpassing the $17 million record held by The Hunger Games: Catching Fire (2013), and is the best opening for an IMAX 2D, non-sequel, and November IMAX release.[112] It had a worldwide opening of $133 million, which was the tenth-largest opening of 2014,[113] and became the tenth-highest-grossing film of 2014.[114] Interstellar is the fourth film to gross over $100 million worldwide from IMAX ticket sales.[115][116][117] It was released in the UK, Ireland and Malta on November 6, 2014, and debuted at number one earning £5.5 million ($8.6 million) in its opening weekend, which was lower than the openings of The Dark Knight Rises (£14.4 million), Gravity (£6.2 million), and Inception (£5.9 million).[118] The film was released in 35 markets on the same day, including major markets like Germany, Russia, Australia, and Brazil earning $8.7 million in total.[119] Through Sunday, it earned an opening weekend total of $83 million from 11.1 million admissions from over 14,800 screens in 62 markets.[120] It earned $7.3 million from 206 IMAX screens, at an average of 35,400 viewers per theater.[121] It went to number one in South Korea ($14.4 million),[122] Russia ($8.9 million), and France ($5.3 million). Other strong openings occurred in Germany ($4.6 million), India ($4.3 million), Italy ($3.7 million), Australia ($3.7 million), Spain ($2.7 million), Mexico ($3.1 million), and Brazil ($1.9 million).[123] Interstellar was released in China on November 12 and earned $5.4 million on its opening day on Wednesday, which is Nolan's biggest opening in China after surpassing the $4.61 million opening record of The Dark Knight Rises.[124][125] It went on to earn $41.7 million in its opening weekend, accounting for 55% of the market share.[126][127] It is Nolan's biggest opening in China, Warner Bros.' biggest 2D opening,[128] and the studio's third-biggest opening of all time, behind 2014's The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies ($49.5 million)[129] and 2013's Pacific Rim ($45 million).[130][131][needs update?]
It topped the box office outside North America for two consecutive weekends before being overtaken by The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 1 (2014) in its third weekend.[128] Just 31 days after its release, the film became the 13th-most-successful film and 3rd-most-successful foreign film in South Korea with 9.1 million admissions trailing only Avatar (13.3 million admissions), and 2013's Frozen (10.3 million admissions).[132] The film closed down its theatrical run in China on December 12, with total revenue of $122.6 million.[133][134] In total earnings, its largest markets outside North America and China were South Korea ($73.4 million), the UK, Ireland and Malta ($31.3 million), and Russia and the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) ($19 million).[135] Interstellar and Big Hero 6 opened the same weekend (November 7–9, 2014) in the US and Canada. Both were forecast to earn between $55 million and $60 million.[136] In North America, the film is the seventh-highest-grossing film to not hit No. 1, with a top rank of No. 2 on its opening weekend.[137] Interstellar had an early limited release in the US and Canada in selected theaters on November 4 at 8:00 pm, coinciding with the 2014 US midterm elections.[138] It topped the box office the following day, earning $1.35 million from 249 theaters (42 of which were IMAX screens); IMAX accounted for 62% of its total gross.[139] Two hundred and forty of those theaters played in 35 mm, 70 mm, and IMAX 70 mm film formats.[140] It earned $3.6 million from late-night shows for a previews total of $4.9 million.[141][142][143] The film was widely released on November 7 and topped the box office on its opening day, earning $17 million ahead of Big Hero 6 ($15.8 million).[144] On its opening weekend, the film earned $47.5 million[b] from 3,561 theaters, debuting in second place after a neck-and-neck competition with Disney's Big Hero 6 ($56.2 million).[146] IMAX comprised $13.2 million (28%) of its opening weekend gross,[146] while other premium large-format screens comprised $5.3 million (10.5%) of the gross.[147][148] In its second weekend, the film fell to No. 3 behind Big Hero 6 and newcomer Dumb and Dumber To (2014), and dropped 39% earning $29 million for a two-weekend total of $98 million.[149][150] It earned $7.4 million from IMAX theaters from 368 screens in its second weekend.[151][152] In its third week, the film earned $15 million and remained at No. 3, below newcomer The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 1 and Big Hero 6.[153]

Critical response[edit]
On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, 73% of 378 critic reviews are positive, with an average of 7.1/10. The site's critics consensus reads, "Interstellar represents more of the thrilling, thought-provoking, and visually resplendent filmmaking moviegoers have come to expect from writer-director Christopher Nolan, even if its intellectual reach somewhat exceeds its grasp."[154] Metacritic assigned the film a score of 74 out of 100 based on 46 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".[155] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave it an average grade of "B+" on an A+ to F scale.[156]
Scott Foundas, chief film critic at Variety, said that Interstellar is "as visually and conceptually audacious as anything Nolan has yet done" and considered the film "more personal" than Nolan's previous films.[157] Claudia Puig of USA Today praised the visual spectacle and powerful themes, while criticizing the "dull" dialogue and "tedious patches inside the space vessel."[158] David Stratton of At the Movies rated the film four-and-a-half stars out of five, commending its ambition, effects, and 70 mm IMAX presentation, though criticizing the sound for "being so loud" as to make some of the dialogue "inaudible". Conversely, co-host Margaret Pomeranz rated the film three out of five, as she felt the human drama got lost among the film's scientific concepts.[159] Henry Barnes of The Guardian scored the film three out of five stars, calling it "a glorious spectacle, but a slight drama, with few characters and too-rare flashes of humour."[160] James Berardinelli called Interstellar "an amazing achievement" and "simultaneously a big-budget science fiction endeavor and a very simple tale of love and sacrifice. It is by turns edgy, breathtaking, hopeful, and heartbreaking."[161] He named it the best film of 2014,[162] and the second-best movie of the decade, deeming it a "real science fiction rather than the crowd-pleasing, watered-down version Hollywood typically offers".[163]



"It's been a while since somebody has come out with such a big vision to things ... Even the elements, the fact that dust is everywhere, and they're living in this dust bowl that is just completely enveloping this area of the world. That's almost something you expect from Tarkovsky or Malick, not a science fiction adventure movie.[164]


—Quentin Tarantino on Interstellar.

Oliver Gettell of the Los Angeles Times reported that "film critics largely agree that Interstellar is an entertaining, emotional, and thought-provoking sci-fi saga, even if it can also be clunky and sentimental at times."[165] James Dyer of Empire awarded the film a full five stars, describing it as "brainy, barmy, and beautiful to behold ... a mind-bending opera of space and time with a soul wrapped up in all the science."[166] Dave Calhoun of Time Out London also granted the film a maximum score of five stars, stating that it is "a bold, beautiful cosmic adventure story with a touch of the surreal and the dreamlike."[167] Richard Roeper of Chicago Sun-Times awarded the film a full four stars and wrote, "This is one of the most beautiful films I have ever seen—in terms of its visuals, and its overriding message about the powerful forces of the one thing we all know but can't measure in scientific terms. Love."[168]
Describing Nolan as a "merchant of awe," Tim Robey of The Telegraph thought that Interstellar was "agonisingly" close to a masterpiece, highlighting the conceptual boldness and "deep-digging intelligence" of the film.[169] Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter wrote, "This grandly conceived and executed epic tries to give equal weight to intimate human emotions and speculation about the cosmos, with mixed results, but is never less than engrossing, and sometimes more than that."[170] In his review for the Associated Press, Jake Coyle praised the film for its "big-screen grandeur," while finding some of the dialogue "clunky." He described it further as "an absurd endeavor" and "one of the most sublime movies of the decade."[171] Scott Mendelson of Forbes listed Interstellar as one of the most disappointing films of 2014, stating that the film "has a lack of flow, loss of momentum following the climax, clumsy sound mixing," and "thin characters" despite seeing the film twice in order to "give it a second chance." He wrote that Interstellar "ends up as a stripped-down and somewhat muted variation on any number of 'go into space to save the world' movies."[172] Matt Zoller Seitz of RogerEbert.com gave the film three-and-a-half out of four stars, saying that despite his usual quibbles regarding Nolan's excessive dialogue and its lack of a sense of composition, "[Interstellar] is still an impressive, at times astonishing movie that overwhelmed me to the point where my usual objections to Nolan's work melted away ... At times, the movie's one-stop-shopping storytelling evokes the tough-tender spirit of a John Ford picture ... a movie that would rather try to be eight or nine things than just one."[173]
New York Times columnist David Brooks concludes that Interstellar explores the relationships among "science and faith and science and the humanities" and "illustrates the real symbiosis between these realms."[174] Mark Steyn commented on the technological future and the focus on the father-daughter relationship.[175] Wai Chee Dimock, in the Los Angeles Review of Books, wrote that Nolan's films are "rotatable at 90, 180, and 360 degrees," and that "although there is considerable magical thinking here, making it almost an anti-sci-fi film, holding out hope that the end of the planet is not the end of everything, it reverses itself, however, when that magic falls short when the poetic license is naked and plain for all to see."[176] Author George R. R. Martin called Interstellar "the most ambitious and challenging science fiction film since Kubrick's 2001."[177] In 2020, Empire magazine ranked it as one of the best films of the 21st century.[178]

These moments when we dare to aim higher, to break barriers, to reach for the stars, to make the unknown known. We count these moments as our proudest achievements.
Interstellar is a 2014 science fiction film about a team of astronauts who travel through a cosmic wormhole in search of a habitable planet as the Earth is ravaged by worldwide crop blights, dust storms and the atmosphere loses oxygen.

Directed by Christopher Nolan. Written by Jonathan Nolan and Christopher Nolan.

Cooper[edit]
We've always defined ourselves by the ability to overcome the impossible.
This world's a treasure, but it's been telling us to leave for a while now.
Once you're a parent, you're the ghost of your children's future.
We used to look up at the sky and wonder at our place in the stars, now we just look down and worry about our place in the dirt.
Mankind was born on Earth. It was never meant to die here.
We've always defined ourselves by the ability to overcome the impossible. And we count these moments. These moments when we dare to aim higher, to break barriers, to reach for the stars, to make the unknown known. We count these moments as our proudest achievements. But we lost all that. Or perhaps we've just forgotten that we are still pioneers. And we've barely begun. And that our greatest accomplishments cannot be behind us, because our destiny lies above us.
Professor Brand[edit]
Do not go gentle into that good night;  Old age should burn and rave at close of day. Rage, rage against the dying of the light.
Quoting famous lines of the poem "Do not go gentle into that good night" by Dylan Thomas
Murphy Cooper[edit]
Today is my birthday. And it's a special one … now I'm the same age that you were when you left ... and it'd be really great if you came back soon.
Eureka!
Today is my birthday. And it's a special one because you once told me that when you came back, we might be the same age. Well, now I'm the same age that you were when you left... and it'd be really great if you came back soon.
Eureka!
Quoting Archimedes when she finishes equations related to information from the black hole about the gravity force.
Amelia Brand[edit]
Love is the one thing that transcends time and space.
Maybe we've spent too long trying to figure all this out with theory.
Love is the one thing that transcends time and space.
You might have to decide between seeing your children again and the future of the human race.
CASE[edit]
TARS talks plenty for both of us...
Cooper, this is no time for caution.
TARS[edit]
Everybody good? Plenty of slaves for my robot colony?
I have a cue light I can use to show you when I'm joking, if you like.
Dialogue[edit]
You don't believe we went to the Moon?
We must confront the reality that nothing in our solar system can help us.
We must reach far beyond our own lifespans. We must think not as individuals but as a species. We must confront the reality of interstellar travel.
Time is relative, it can stretch and squeeze, but it can't run backwards. The only thing that can move across dimensions like time is gravity.
Look, Cooper, they're creatures of at least five dimensions, to them the past might be a canyon they can climb into and the future a mountain they can climb up... but to us it's not, okay?
Young Murph: Dad, why did you and mom name me after something that's bad?
Cooper: Well, we didn't.
Young Murph: Murphy's law?
Cooper: Murphy's law doesn't mean that something bad will happen. It means that whatever can happen will happen.

Cooper: You're ruling out college for my son now? He's 15.
Principal: Tom's score simply isn't high enough.
Cooper: What's your waist line? What 32, 33 inseam?
Principal: I'm not sure I see what you're getting at.
Cooper: You're telling me it takes two numbers to measure your own ass but only one to measure my son's future?

Cooper: You don't believe we went to the Moon?
Ms. Hanley: I believe it was a brilliant piece of propaganda, that the Soviets bankrupted themselves pouring resources into rockets and other useless machines...
Cooper: Useless machines?
Ms. Hanley: ..and if we don't want to repeat of the excess and wastefulness of the 20th Century then we need to teach our kids about this planet, not tales of leaving it.
Cooper: You know, one of those useless machines they used to make was called an MRI, and if we had one of those left the doctors would have been able to find the cyst in my wife's brain, before she died instead of afterwards, and then she would've been the one sitting here, listening to this instead of me. Which would've been a good thing because she was always the ... calmer one.

Prof. Brand: We must confront the reality that nothing in our solar system can help us.
Cooper: Now you need to tell me what your plan is to save the world.
Prof. Brand: We're not meant to save the world. We're meant to leave it, and this is the mission you were trained for.
Cooper: I've got kids, Professor.
Prof. Brand: Then get out there and save them. We must reach far beyond our own lifespans. We must think not as individuals but as a species. We must confront the reality of interstellar travel.

Cooper: It is hard leaving everything... my kids, your father...
Brand: We're gonna be spending a lot of time together.
Cooper: We should learn to talk.
Brand: And when not to? … Just being honest.
Cooper: I don't think you need to be that honest.

Doyle: The lost communications came through.
Brand: How?
Doyle: The relay on this side cached them. Years of basic data, no real surprises. Miller's site has kept pinging thumbs up, as has Mann... but Edmunds went down three years ago.
Brand: Transmitter failure?
Doyle: Maybe. He was sending thumbs up right till it went dark.
Romilly: Miller still looks good? [Doyle nods, and Romilly begins drawing on a whiteboard] She's coming up fast ... with one complication: the planet is much closer to Gargantua than we thought.
Cooper: Gargantua?
Doyle: A very large black hole. Miller's and Dr. Mann's planets orbit it.
Brand: And Miller's is right on the horizon?
Romilly: A basketball on the hoop. Landing there takes us dangerously close. A black hole that big has a huge gravitational pull.
Cooper: Look, I can swing around that neutron star and decelerate—
Brand: It's not that, it's time. That gravity will slow our clock compared to Earth. Drastically.
Cooper: How bad?
Romilly: Every hour we spend down there will be maybe... seven years back on Earth.
Cooper: Jesus...
Romilly: That's relativity, folks.

Cooper: Ready?
CASE: Yup.
Cooper: Don't say much, do you?
CASE: TARS talks plenty for both of us.

Cooper: We wanna get down fast, don't we?
Brand: Actually we want to get there in one piece.
Cooper: Hang on.

Brand: I told you to leave me.
Cooper: And I told you to get your ass back here! Difference is, only one of us was thinking about the mission—
Brand: Cooper, you were thinking about getting home — I was trying to do the right thing!
Cooper: Tell that to Doyle. [pause] How long to drain, CASE?
CASE: Forty-five to an hour.
Cooper: The stuff of life, huh? What's this gonna cost us, Brand?
Brand: A lot. Decades.
Cooper: What happened to Miller?
Brand: Judging by the wreckage, she was broken up by a wave shortly after impact.
Cooper: How could the wreckage still be together after all these years?
Brand: Because of the time slippage. on this planet's time, she landed here just hours ago. She might have died only minutes ago.
CASE: The data Doyle collected was just the initial status, echoing endlessly.
Cooper: We're not prepared for this, Brand. You're a bunch of eggheads without the survival skills of a boy-scout troop.
Brand: We got this far on our brains, farther than any humans in history...
Cooper: No, not far enough. And we're stuck here till there won't be anyone left on Earth to save—
Brand: I'm counting every second, same as you, Cooper.
Cooper: Don't you have some clever way we jump into a black hole and get back the years? [Brand shakes her head] Don't you shake your head at me!
Brand: Time is relative, it can stretch and squeeze, but it can't run backwards. The only thing that can move across dimensions like time is gravity.
Cooper: The beings that led us here ... they communicate through gravity ... Could they be talking to us from the future?
Brand: Maybe.
Cooper: Well, if they can—
Brand: Look, Cooper, they're creatures of at least five dimensions, to them the past might be a canyon they can climb into and the future a mountain they can climb up... but to us it's not, okay? I'm sorry, Cooper. I screwed up. But you know about relativity.
Cooper: My daughter was ten. I couldn't explain Einstein's theories before I left.
Brand: Could you tell her you were going to save the world?
Cooper: No. I wasn't much of a parent, but I understood the most important thing — let your kids feel safe. Which rules out telling ten-year-old that the world's ending.

Cooper:[As he tries to reconfigure TARS personality settings] Humour 75%.
TARS: Confirmed. Self destruct sequence in T minus 10… 9…
Cooper: Let's make that 60%.
TARS: 60%, confirmed. Knock, knock.
Cooper: You want fifty-five?
Cooper, what are you doing?! Docking.

TARS: [As Cooper suddenly accelerates towards an out-of-control Endurance] Cooper, there's no point in using our fuel to chase-
Cooper: Analyze the Endurance's spin.
Brand: Cooper, what are you doing?!
Cooper: Docking.

CASE: This is not possible.
Cooper: No. It's necessary.

Cooper: What's your trust setting, TARS?
TARS: Lower than yours, apparently.

Murph: [as Cooper holds his now elderly daughter's hands] Nobody believed me, but I knew you'd come back.
Cooper: How?
Murph: ...Because my dad promised me.

Quotes about Interstellar[edit]
I grew up in an era that was the golden age of blockbusters, with films like Close Encounters and the way that addressed the idea of this moment when humans would meet aliens from a family perspective and a very relatable human perspective. I liked the idea of trying to give today’s audiences some sense of that form of storyline. ~ Christopher Nolan
The Times' Kenneth Turan gave a glowing review, writing that "though it's a big studio blockbuster with all the traditional plot elements the term implies, 'Interstellar' turns out to be the rarest beast in the Hollywood jungle. It's a mass audience picture that's intelligent as well as epic, with a sophisticated script that's as interested in emotional moments as immersive visuals. Which is saying a lot."
The New York Times' A.O. Scott wrote, "It may be enough to say that 'Interstellar' is a terrifically entertaining science-fiction movie, giving fresh life to scenes and situations we've seen a hundred times before, and occasionally stumbling over pompous dialogue or overly portentous music."
USA Today's Claudia Puig was more measured in her appraisal, writing, "While it reaches for the stars, director Christopher Nolan's 'Interstellar ' is a flawed masterpiece. The story is ever-ambitious, sometimes riveting and thought-provoking, but also plodding and hokey and not as visionary as its cutting-edge special effects. And at nearly three hours, the film would have benefited from more judicious editing."
The Associated Press' Jake Coyle said that at its heart, "Interstellar" is "a father-daughter tale grandly spun across a cosmic tapestry. He continued: "There is turbulence along the way. 'Interstellar' is overly explanatory about its physics, its dialogue can be clunky and you may want to send composer Hans Zimmer's relentless organ into deep space. But if you take these for blips rather than black holes, the majesty of 'Interstellar' is something to behold."
For the Washington Post's Ann Hornaday, the film didn't quite come together. She said that "there are moments of genuine awe and majesty in 'Interstellar,' but there are just as many passages that play as if Nolan is less interested in value for the viewers than proving a point, whether about the arcana of quantum physics, his technical prowess or the enduring power of love."  McConaughey makes for "a compelling, even believable hero," she continued, but "too often, the father-daughter dynamics that propel 'Interstellar' ... feel shrewdly calculated, the emotionalism ginned up to a hysterically maudlin pitch." Ultimately, the film "tries so hard to be so many things that it winds up shrinking into itself, much like one of the collapsed stars [McConaughey's character] hurtles past on his way to new worlds."
And the Boston Globe's Ty Burr wrote, "there's only so much you can pile on the pie plate before it starts spilling rhubarb on the floor. The parts of 'Interstellar' that don't work ... struggle against the many parts that do. Nolan is one of the few working filmmakers with the skill set to take us far beyond our normal moviegoing orbit, but his vision keeps coming up against the curves of the known pop universe. He's the showman who fancies himself a philosopher."
Oliver Gettell, "'Interstellar' is an ambitious, imperfect sci-fi epic, reviews say", Las Angeles Times, (Nov 5, 2014).
The movies you grow up with, the culture you absorb through the decades, become part of your expectations while watching a film. So you can't make any film in a vacuum. We're making a science-fiction film... You can't pretend 2001 doesn't exist when you're making Interstellar. … I grew up in an era that was the golden age of blockbusters, with films like Close Encounters and the way that addressed the idea of this moment when humans would meet aliens from a family perspective and a very relatable human perspective. I liked the idea of trying to give today’s audiences some sense of that form of storyline.
Christopher Nolan, as quoted in "‘Interstellar’ Q & A: Nolan Set Out To Make Modern-Day ‘Close Encounters’" by Matt Mueller, at Thompson on Hollywood (29 October 2014)
I think really space exploration, to me, has always represented the most hopeful and optimistic endeavor that mankind has ever really engaged with.  I was certainly struck when they flew the space shuttle in, the 747 when it came to the science center here in LA, were up in Griffith Park with hundreds of people waving flags and watching this thing fly down and it was a very moving moment actually, and a little melancholy at the same time, because what we felt was that sense of that great endeavor, that great collective endeavor, the hope and optimism of that is something it feels like we’re in need of again.  I feel very strongly that we’re at a point now where we need to start looking out again and exploring our place in the universe more.
I had the advantage of coming to the project late, being able to look at what these guys had done, and a lot of my contribution was stripping things down, because they put in all these incredible mind-blowing ideas but I felt that it was more than I could absorb as an audience member.  So I spent a lot of time in my work on the script kind of choosing what I thought were the most emotive, the most tactile of these ideas, things I could really grab a hold of.  Then I found working with Kip to be very liberating because it wasn’t so much restraint of “well, science says you can’t do this”, it was more an exploration of ideas with him of “OK, what’s plausible?  We could go here, we could go there.”  I found it very exciting to work with him on that.
I don’t like to talk about messages so much with films simply because it’s a little more didactic.  The reason I’m a filmmaker is to tell stories and so you hope that they will have resonance for people and for the kind of things you’re talking about, but what I always loved about Jonah’s original draft, and we always retained this, was the idea of blight, the idea of there being an agricultural crisis, which has happened historically if you look at the potato famine and so forth.  We combined this with ideas taken very much from Ken Burns documentary on the Dust Bowl and spoke to Ken at great length and availed ourselves of his resources, because what struck me about the dust bowl is it was man-made environmental crisis, but one where the imagery – the effect of it was so outlandish we actually had to tone it down for what we put in the film.  But the real point is they’re non-specific, that we’re saying that in our story man-kind is being gently nudged off the planet by the earth itself and the reason is non-specific, because we don’t want to be too didactic or too political about it.  That’s not really the point.  For me it goes back to something Emma said earlier, which was that my excitement about the project was addressing a possibly extremely negative idea, in terms of the planet having had enough of us and suggesting that we go somewhere else, but that being an opportunity, that being a great exciting adventure to be on was something I found very winning about it.
Christopher Nolan in Christopher Nolan, Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, and More Talk INTERSTELLAR, the Evolution of the Script, and Grounding the Film with Emotion" by Steve 'Frosty' Weintraub, Collider, (November 8, 2014).
It’s very straightforward: selfishness and cowardice. It’s very human, and I love what Matt did with that; he found the reality of it. It’s the kind of sequence where you loathe the guy because he’s doing something that you feel you might wind up doing in a similar situation. It’s very logical, but the rationalization of it is extraordinary — the way he was able to rationalize his own cowardice into a positive thing. Loneliness and desperation will make us do crazy things.
[Mann is] not exactly crazy. It’s weirdly logical, but appallingly selfish. The only outcome to the mission for him was [a colony]. I think, and it’s something we talked a lot about — and it’s something he says in the film — that there was no doubt in his mind that his was going to be the planet, his was going to be the mission. So whatever the risks, he felt very confident. And when he’s confronted by the bleak reality of just dying out there alone, it all starts to unravel.
Christopher Nolan, as quoted in "Christopher Nolan Talks ‘Interstellar’ Ending and That Big Third-Act Twist" in /Film by Angie Han (21 November 2014)
The inception of the project for me began in 2006 or 2007, that was when I first started thinking about it – and I was struck in that moment by what felt, for a variety of reasons, felt like to be growing up in this age, to be growing up in this country, in this moment in time – there’s a line about this in the film – it feels like every day is Christmas.  There’s some remarkable technology, there’s some remarkable thing.  You get to a certain moment where you realize all those humans who landed on the moon did so in between Chris being born and me being born and no one had gone back since, all these Super-8 films we grew up watching of rocket launches, you get to a certain age and you realize all the speeches about going back, they’re speeches, there’s no money there, we’re not going back.  And that moment, it felt like the melancholy or the sadness of that was to imagine as a species that we might have peaked, that if you charted our evolution as a species in terms of altitude, we peaked in 1973.  That was kind of a sad realization.  Growing up you’re promised jet packs and we got Instagram.  Kind of a bum deal, I think.  So I was rooted in the optimism of what is the next moment in which we start to journey again.
Jonathan Nolan in Christopher Nolan, Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, and More Talk INTERSTELLAR, the Evolution of the Script, and Grounding the Film with Emotion" by Steve 'Frosty' Weintraub, Collider, (November 8, 2014).
The state-of-the-art sci-fi landscapes are deployed in service of Hallmark card homilies about how people should live, and what’s really important. ("We love people who have died—what's the social utility in that?" "Accident is the first step in evolution.") After a certain point it sinks in, or should sink in, that Nolan and his co-screenwriter, brother Jonathan Nolan, aren’t trying to one-up the spectacular rationalism of “2001." The movie's science fiction trappings are just a wrapping for a spiritual/emotional dream about basic human desires (for home, for family, for continuity of bloodline and culture), as well as for a horror film of sorts—one that treats the star voyagers’ and their earthbound loved ones’ separation as spectacular metaphors for what happens when the people we value are taken from us by death, illness, or unbridgeable distance. (“Pray you never learn just how good it can be to see another face,” another astronaut says, after years alone in an interstellar wilderness.)  While "Interstellar" never entirely commits to the idea of a non-rational, uncanny world, it nevertheless has a mystical strain, one that's unusually pronounced for a director whose storytelling has the right-brained sensibility of an engineer, logician, or accountant. There's a ghost in this film, writing out messages to the living in dust. Characters strain to interpret distant radio messages as if they were ancient texts written in a dead language, and stare through red-rimmed eyes at video messages sent years ago, by people on the other side of the cosmos. "Interstellar" features a family haunted by the memory of a dead mother and then an absent father; a woman haunted by the memory of a missing father, and another woman who's separated from her own dad (and mentor), and driven to reunite with a lover separated from her by so many millions of miles that he might as well be dead.
The film's widescreen panoramas feature harsh interplanetary landscapes, shot in cruel Earth locales; some of the largest and most detailed starship miniatures ever built, and space sequences presented in scientifically accurate silence, a la "2001." But for all its high-tech glitz, "Interstellar" has a defiantly old-movie feeling. It's not afraid to switch, even lurch, between modes. At times, the movie's one-stop-shopping storytelling evokes the tough-tender spirit of a John Ford picture, or a Steven Spielberg film made in the spirit of a Ford picture: a movie that would rather try to be eight or nine things than just one. Bruising outer-space action sequences, with astronauts tumbling in zero gravity and striding across forbidding landscapes, give way to snappy comic patter (mostly between Cooper and the ship's robot, TARS, designed in Minecraft-style, pixel-ish boxes, and voiced by Bill Irwin). There are long explanatory sequences, done with and without dry erase boards, dazzling vistas that are less spaces than mind-spaces, and tearful separations and reconciliations that might as well be played silent, in tinted black-and-white, and scored with a saloon piano. (Spielberg originated "Interstellar" in 2006, but dropped out to direct other projects.)  McConaughey, a super-intense actor who wholeheartedly commits to every line and moment he's given, is the right leading man for this kind of film. Cooper proudly identifies himself as an engineer as well as an astronaut and farmer, but he has the soul of a goofball poet; when he stares at intergalactic vistas, he grins like a kid at an amusement park waiting to ride a new roller coaster. Cooper's farewell to his daughter Murph—who's played by McKenzie Foy as a young girl—is shot very close-in, and lit in warm, cradling tones; it has some of the tenderness of the porch swing scene in "To Kill a Mockingbird." When Murph grows up into Jessica Chastain—a key member of Caine's NASA crew, and a surrogate for the daughter that the elder Brand "lost' to the Endurance's mission—we keep thinking about that goodbye scene, and how its anguish drives everything that Murph and Cooper are trying to do, while also realizing that similar feelings drive the other characters—indeed, the rest of the species. (One suspects this is a deeply personal film for Nolan: it's about a man who feels he has been "called" to a particular job, and whose work requires him to spend long periods away from his family.)
