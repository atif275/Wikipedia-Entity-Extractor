Discussion in the main lecture hall at the
École de Physique des Houches
(Les Houches Physics School), 1972. From left,

Bryce DeWitt
, Thorne,
Demetrios Christodoulou
.
Thorne was born on June 1, 1940, in
Logan, Utah
. His father, D. Wynne Thorne (1908–1979), was a professor of
soil chemistry
at
Utah State University
, and his mother, Alison (née Comish; 1914–2004), was an economist and the first woman to receive a
PhD
in economics from
Iowa State College
.
[10]
[11]
Raised in an academic environment, two of his four siblings also became professors.
[12]
[13]
Thorne's parents were members of
the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints
(LDS Church) and raised Thorne in the LDS faith, though he now describes himself as
atheist
.  Regarding his views on science and religion, Thorne has stated: "There are large numbers of my finest colleagues who are quite devout and believe in God .... There is no fundamental incompatibility between science and religion. I happen to not believe in God."
[14]
Thorne rapidly excelled at academics early in life, winning recognition in the
Westinghouse Science Talent Search
as a senior at
Logan High School
.
[15]
He received his
BS
degree from the
California Institute of Technology
(Caltech) in 1962, and his PhD from
Princeton University
in 1965 under the supervision of
John Archibald Wheeler
with a
doctoral dissertation
entitled "
Geometrodynamics
of Cylindrical Systems".
[16]
Thorne returned to Caltech as an associate professor in 1967 and became a professor of theoretical physics in 1970, becoming one of the youngest full professors in the history of Caltech at age 30. He became the William R. Kenan, Jr. Professor in 1981, and the
Feynman
Professor of Theoretical Physics in 1991. He was an adjunct professor at the
University of Utah
from 1971 to 1998 and Andrew D. White Professor at Large at
Cornell University
from 1986 to 1992.
[17]
In June 2009, he resigned his Feynman Professorship (he is now the Feynman Professor of Theoretical Physics, Emeritus) to pursue a career of writing and movie making.
[

His first film project was
Interstellar
, on which he worked with
Christopher Nolan
and
Jonathan Nolan
.
[7]
Throughout the years, Thorne has served as a mentor and thesis advisor to many leading theorists who now work on observational, experimental, or astrophysical aspects of general relativity. Approximately 50 physicists have received PhDs at Caltech under Thorne's personal mentorship.
[7]
Thorne is known for his ability to convey the excitement and significance of discoveries in gravitation and astrophysics to both professional and lay audiences. His presentations on subjects such as
black holes
,
gravitational radiation
,
relativity
,
time travel
, and
wormholes
have been included in
PBS
shows in the U.S. and on the
BBC
in the United Kingdom.

Thorne and Linda Jean Peterson married in 1960. Their children are Kares Anne and Bret Carter, an architect. Thorne and Peterson divorced in 1977. Thorne and his second wife, Carolee Joyce Winstein, a professor of
biokinesiology
and physical therapy at
USC
, married in 1984.
[18]
Research
[
edit
]
Thorne in 1972
Thorne's research has principally focused on
relativistic
astrophysics
and
gravitation physics
, with emphasis on
relativistic stars
, black holes and especially
gravitational waves
.
[7]
He is perhaps best known to the public for his controversial theory that wormholes can conceivably be used for time travel.
[19]
However, Thorne's scientific contributions, which center on the general nature of
space
, time, and
gravity
, span the full range of topics in general relativity.
Gravitational waves and LIGO
[
edit
]
Thorne's work has dealt with the prediction of gravitational wave strengths and their temporal signatures as observed on Earth. These "signatures" are of great relevance to
LIGO
(Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory), a multi-institution gravitational wave experiment for which Thorne has been a leading proponent – in 1984, he cofounded the LIGO Project (the largest project ever funded by the
NSF
[20]
) to discern and measure any fluctuations between two or more 'static' points; such fluctuations would be evidence of gravitational waves, as calculations describe. A significant aspect of his research is developing the
mathematics
necessary to analyze these objects.
[21]
Thorne also carries out
engineering
design analyses for features of the LIGO that cannot be developed on the basis of
experiment
and he gives advice on
data analysis
algorithms
by which the waves will be sought. He has provided theoretical support for LIGO, including identifying gravitational wave sources that LIGO should target, designing the baffles to control
scattered light
in the LIGO beam tubes, and – in collaboration with
Vladimir Braginsky
's (Moscow, Russia) research group – inventing
quantum nondemolition
designs for advanced gravity-wave detectors and ways to reduce the most serious kind of
noise
in advanced detectors:
thermoelastic noise
. With
Carlton M. Caves
, Thorne invented the back-action-evasion approach to quantum nondemolition measurements of the
harmonic oscillators
– a technique applicable both in gravitational wave detection and
quantum optics
.
[7]
On February 11, 2016, a team of four physicists
[a]
representing the
LIGO Scientific Collaboration
, announced that in September 2015, LIGO recorded the signature of two black holes colliding 1.3 billion light-years away.  This recorded detection was the first direct observation of the
fleeting chirp of a gravitational wave
and confirmed a prediction of the general theory of relativity.

Black hole cosmology

Main article:
Hoop conjecture
A cylindrical bundle of magnetic field lines
While studying for his PhD at Princeton University, his mentor
John Wheeler
assigned him a problem to think over: find out whether or not a cylindrical bundle of repulsive magnetic field lines will implode under its own attractive gravitational force. After several months wrestling with the problem, he proved that it was impossible for cylindrical
magnetic field
lines to
implode
.
[27]
: 262–265
Why won't a cylindrical bundle of magnetic field lines implode, while spherical stars
will
implode under their own gravitational force? Thorne tried to explore the theoretical ridge between these two phenomena. He eventually determined that the gravitational force can overcome all interior pressure only when an object has been compressed in all directions. To express this realization, Thorne proposed his
hoop conjecture
, which describes an imploding star turning into a black hole when the critical circumference of the designed hoop can be placed around it and set into rotation. That is, any object of mass M around which a hoop of circumference
4
π
G
M
c
2
{\displaystyle {\begin{matrix}{\frac {4\pi GM}{c^{2}}}\end{matrix}}}
can be spun must be a black hole.
[27]
: 266–267
[28]
: 189–190
As a tool to be used in both enterprises — astrophysics and theoretical physics — Thorne and his students have developed an unusual approach, called the "
membrane paradigm
", to the theory of black holes and used it to clarify the "Blandford-Znajek" mechanism by which black holes may power some
quasars
and
active galactic nuclei
.
[27]
: 405–411
Thorne has investigated the
quantum
statistical mechanical
origin of the
entropy
of a black hole. With his
postdoc
Wojciech Zurek, he showed that the entropy of a black hole is the
logarithm
of the number of ways that the hole could have been made.
[27]
: 445–446
With
Igor Novikov
and
Don Page
, he developed the general relativistic theory of thin
accretion disks
around black holes, and using this theory he deduced that with a doubling of its mass by such
accretion
a black hole will be spun up to 0.998 of the maximum
spin
allowed by general relativity, but not any farther. This is probably the maximum black-hole spin allowed in nature.
[7]
Wormholes and time travel
[
edit
]
A wormhole is a short cut connecting two separate regions in space.  In the figure the green line shows the short way through wormhole, and the red line shows the long way through normal space.
Thorne and his co-workers at Caltech conducted scientific research on whether the laws of physics permit space and time to be
multiply connected
(can there exist classical,
traversable wormholes
and "time machines"?).
[29]
With Sung-Won Kim, Thorne identified a universal physical mechanism (the explosive growth of
vacuum polarization
of
quantum fields
), that may always prevent spacetime from developing
closed timelike curves
(i.e., prevent
backward time travel
).
[30]
With
Mike Morris
and
Ulvi Yurtsever
, he showed that traversable wormholes can exist in the structure of
spacetime
only if they are threaded by quantum fields in
quantum states
that violate the
averaged null energy condition
(i.e. have negative renormalized energy spread over a sufficiently large region).
[31]
This has triggered research to explore the ability of quantum fields to possess such extended
negative energy
. Recent calculations by Thorne indicate that simple masses passing through traversable wormholes could never engender
paradoxes
– there are
no
initial conditions that lead to paradox once time travel is introduced. If his results can be generalized, they would suggest that none of the supposed paradoxes formulated in time travel stories can actually be formulated at a precise physical level: that is, that
any
situation in a time travel story turns out to permit
many
consistent solutions.

Relativistic stars, multipole moments and other endeavors
[
edit
]
With
Anna Żytkow
, Thorne predicted the existence of
red supergiant stars
with
neutron-star
cores (
Thorne–Żytkow objects
).
[32]
He laid the foundations for the theory of
pulsations
of relativistic stars and the gravitational radiation they emit. With
James Hartle
, Thorne derived from general relativity the laws of motion and precession of black holes and other relativistic bodies, including the influence of the coupling of their
multipole moments
to the spacetime curvature of nearby objects,
[33]
as well as writing down the
Hartle-Thorne metric
, an approximate solution which describes the exterior of a slowly and rigidly rotating, stationary and axially symmetric body.
Thorne has also theoretically predicted the existence of universally antigravitating "
exotic matter
" – the element needed to accelerate the expansion rate of the universe, keep traversable wormhole "Star Gates" open and keep
timelike
geodesic
free float "
warp drives
" working. With Clifford Will
[34]
and others of his students, he laid the foundations for the theoretical interpretation of experimental
tests of relativistic theories of gravity
– foundations on which Will and others then built. As of 2005
[update]
, Thorne was interested in the origin of classical space and time from the
quantum foam
of
quantum gravity
theory.

Publications
[
edit
]
Thorne has written and edited books on topics in gravitational theory and
high-energy astrophysics
. In 1973, he co-authored the textbook
Gravitation
with
Charles Misner
and
John Wheeler
;
[35]
that according to
John C. Baez
and Chris Hillman, is one of the great scientific books of all time and has inspired two generations of students.
[36]
In 1994, he published
Black Holes and Time Warps: Einstein's Outrageous Legacy
, a book for non-scientists for which he received numerous awards. This book has been published in six languages, and editions in Chinese, Italian, Czech, and Polish are in press.

Adaptation in media
[
edit
]
Thorne contributed ideas on wormhole travel to
Carl Sagan
for use in his novel
Contact
.
[53]
Thorne and his friend, producer
Lynda Obst
, also developed the concept for the Christopher Nolan film
Interstellar
.
[54]
He also wrote a tie-in book,
The Science of Interstellar
. Thorne later advised Nolan on the physics of his movie
Tenet
,
[55]
and advised
Cillian Murphy
on his portrayal of
J. Robert Oppenheimer
in Nolan's film
Oppenheimer
.
[56]
In
Larry Niven
's novel
Rainbow Mars
, the time travel technology used in the novel is based on the wormhole theories of Thorne, which in the context of the novel was when time travel first became possible, rather than just fantasy. As a result, any attempts to travel in time prior to Thorne's development of wormhole theory results in the time traveller entering a fantastic version of reality, rather than the actual past.
[57]
In the film
The Theory of Everything
, Thorne was portrayed by actor
Enzo Cilenti
.
[58]
Thorne played himself in the episode of
The Big Bang Theory
entitled "The Laureate Accumulation".
Thorne is featured in an episode of the documentary series
The Craftsman
entitled "Science, Art & Inspiration".
