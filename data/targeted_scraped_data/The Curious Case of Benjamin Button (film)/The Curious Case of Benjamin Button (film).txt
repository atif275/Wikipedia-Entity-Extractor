Plot
[
edit
]
In August 2005, Daisy Fuller is on her deathbed in a
New Orleans
hospital. She tells her daughter Caroline about blind clockmaker Mr. Gateau, hired to make a clock for a train station in 1918. It ran backwards and was made as a memorial for those who lost their sons in
World War I
, like Gateau himself. Daisy then asks Caroline to read aloud from Benjamin Button's diary.
On the evening of
November 11, 1918
, a boy is born with the appearance and maladies of an elderly man. His mother, Caroline, dies soon after childbirth and his father, wealthy manufacturer Thomas Button, abandons him on the porch of a
nursing home
. Caretaker Queenie and cook Mr. Weathers find the baby, and Queenie raises him as her own, naming him Benjamin. As the years pass, Benjamin physically blends in with the elderly residents but has the mind of a child. Physically aging in reverse, he transitions from a wheelchair to crutches and learns to walk.
On
Thanksgiving
1930, Benjamin meets seven-year-old Daisy, whose grandmother lives in the nursing home, and they connect instantly. Later, he accepts work on the
tugboat
Chelsea
captained by Mike Clark. Thomas introduces himself to Benjamin, but does not reveal his true identity. In autumn 1936, Benjamin leaves for a work engagement with the tugboat crew and travels around the world. He sends
postcards
to Daisy, who is accepted into a
ballet
company in
New York City
.
In
Murmansk
in 1941, Benjamin becomes smitten with Elizabeth Abbott, wife of the chief minister of the British
trade mission
in Murmansk.
[5]
Their affair eventually ends, leaving Benjamin heartbroken. That December, the
United States enters
World War II
. Mike volunteers the
Chelsea
for
U.S. Navy
service, and they are assigned to salvage duties. They find a near sunken U.S. transport and thousands of dead American troops. The culprit, a
German
U-boat
, surfaces and fires on the tugboat. Captain Mike rams the submarine and the resulting explosion sinks both. Most of the crew perishes except for Benjamin and Rick Brody, who are eventually rescued.
In May 1945, Benjamin returns to New Orleans, reuniting with Queenie and learns that Weathers died. He reconnects with Daisy, who attempts to seduce him. However, Benjamin refuses, and she departs. Benjamin visits terminally ill Thomas and learns the details of his birth and family. Thomas gives his
button
manufacturing company and estate to Benjamin before dying.
In 1947, Benjamin visits Daisy in New York unannounced but departs upon seeing her romantically involved with someone else. In 1954, Daisy's dancing career ends when her leg is crushed in an automobile accident in
Paris
. When Benjamin visits her, Daisy is amazed by his appearance, but, frustrated by her injuries, she tells him to stay out of her life.
In 1962, Daisy returns to New Orleans and reunites with Benjamin. Now of comparable physical age, they fall in love. Queenie dies, and Benjamin and Daisy move in together. In 1967, Daisy, who has opened a ballet studio, announces she is pregnant. Their daughter, Caroline, is born in the spring of 1968. Believing he cannot be a proper father due to his reverse aging, Benjamin sells his assets, leaves the money for Daisy and Caroline, and leaves to travel alone during the 1970s.
Benjamin, physically a young man, returns to Daisy in 1980. Now married, Daisy introduces him as a family friend to her husband Robert and Caroline. She later visits him at his hotel, where they have sex and part once more. In 1990, recently
widowed
Daisy is contacted by social workers who found Benjamin, who is now physically a
pre-teen
. He was living in a condemned building, was taken to the hospital in poor physical condition, and his diary had her name in it. Benjamin displays early signs of
dementia
, so Daisy moves into the nursing home in 1997 and cares for Benjamin for the rest of his life as he regresses into infancy.
In 2002, Gateau's clock is replaced with a properly working modern
digital clock
and in 2003, Benjamin dies in Daisy's arms, physically an infant but chronologically over 84 years old. Back in 2005, having revealed that Benjamin is Caroline's father, Daisy dies.
Hurricane Katrina
floods a storage room holding Gateau's clock, which keeps ticking backwards.

Development
[
edit

Producer
Ray Stark
bought the film rights to do
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button
in the mid-1980s, and it was optioned by
Universal Pictures
. The first choice to direct it was
Frank Oz
, with
Martin Short
attached for the title role, but Oz could not work out how to make the story work. The film was optioned in 1991 by
Steven Spielberg
, with
Tom Cruise
attached for the lead role, but Spielberg left the project to direct
Jurassic Park
(1993) and
Schindler's List
(1993). Other directors attached were
Patrick Read Johnson
and
Agnieszka Holland
. Stark eventually sold the rights to producers
Kathleen Kennedy
and
Frank Marshall
, who took the film to
Paramount Pictures
, with Universal still on as a co-production partner. By summer 1994, Maryland Film Office chief Jack Gerbes was approached with the possibility of making the film in
Baltimore
. In October 1998, screenwriter
Robin Swicord
wrote for director
Ron Howard
an adapted screenplay of the short story, a project which would potentially star actor
John Travolta
.
[6]
In May 2000, Paramount hired screenwriter
Jim Taylor
to adapt a screenplay from the short story. The studio also attached director
Spike Jonze
to helm the project.
[7]
Screenwriter
Charlie Kaufman
had also written a draft of the adapted screenplay at one point.
[8]
In June 2003, director
Gary Ross
entered final negotiations to helm the project based on a new draft penned by screenwriter
Eric Roth
.
[9]
In May 2004, director
David Fincher
entered negotiations to replace Ross in directing the film.
[10]
Casting
[
edit
]
In May 2005,
Brad Pitt
and
Cate Blanchett
entered negotiations to star in the film.
[11]
In September 2006,
Tilda Swinton
,
Jason Flemyng
and
Taraji P. Henson
entered negotiations to be cast into the film.
[12]
The following October, with production yet to begin,
Julia Ormond
was cast as Daisy's daughter, to whom Blanchett's character tells the story of her love for Benjamin Button.
[13]
Brad Pitt had collaborated with many of his co-stars in previous films. He co-starred with Ormond in
Legends of the Fall
, with Flemyng in
Snatch
, with
Jared Harris
in
Ocean's Twelve
, with Blanchett in
Babel
and with Swinton in
Burn After Reading
.
Filming
[
edit
]
Some filming was conducted in the
Garden District
of New Orleans, including this home at 2707 Coliseum St.
Parisian scenes shooting in
Old Montreal
For
Benjamin Button
,
New Orleans
,
Louisiana
and the surrounding area was chosen as the filming location for the story to take advantage of the state's production incentives, and shooting was slated to begin in October 2006.
[14]
By filming in Louisiana and taking advantage of the state's film incentive, the production received $27 million, which was used to finance a significant portion of the film's $167 million budget.
[15]
[16]
Filming of
Benjamin Button
began on November 6, 2006 in New Orleans. In January 2007, Blanchett joined the shoot.
[17]
Fincher praised the ease of accessibility to rural and urban sets in New Orleans and said that the recovery from
Hurricane Katrina
did not serve as an atypical hindrance to production.
[18]
In March 2007, production moved to
Los Angeles
for two more months of filming.
Principal photography
was targeted to last a total of 150 days. Additional time was needed at visual effects house
Digital Domain
to make the visual effects for the metamorphosis of Brad Pitt's character to the infant stage.
[19]
The director used a camera system called
Contour
, developed by
Steve Perlman
, to capture facial deformation data from live-action performances.
[20]
Several digital environments for the film were created by Matte World Digital, including multiple shots of the interior of the New Orleans train station, to show architectural alterations and deterioration throughout different eras. The train station was built as a 3D model and lighting and aging effects were added, using Next Limit's Maxwell rendering software—an architectural visualization tool.
[21]
Overall production was finished in September 2007.

[30]
Yahoo! Movies
reported the film received a B+ average score from critical consensus, based on 12 reviews.
[31]
Audiences surveyed by
CinemaScore
gave the film a grade A− on scale of A to F.
[32]
The performances of
Brad Pitt
and
Taraji P. Henson
garnered widespread critical acclaim, earning them
Academy Award
nominations for
Best Actor
and
Best Supporting Actress
respectively.
Todd McCarthy
of
Variety
magazine gave the film a positive review, calling it a "richly satisfying serving of deep-dish Hollywood storytelling."
[33]
Peter Howell of
The Toronto Star
says: "It's been said that
the unexamined life is not worth living
.
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button
suggests an addendum: a life lived backwards can be far more enriching" and describes the film as "a magical and moving account of a man living his life resoundingly in reverse" and "moviemaking at its best."
[34]
Rod Yates of
Empire
awarded it five out of a possible five stars.
[35]
[36]
Kirk Honeycutt of
The Hollywood Reporter
felt the film was "superbly made and winningly acted by Brad Pitt in his most impressive outing to date." Honeycutt praised Fincher's directing of the film and noted that the "cinematography wonderfully marries a palette of subdued earthen colors with the necessary CGI and other visual effects that place one in a magical past." Honeycutt states the bottom line about
Benjamin Button
is that it is "an intimate epic about love and loss that is
pure cinema
."
[37]
A. O. Scott
of
The New York Times
states: "
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button
, more than two and a half hours long, sighs with longing and simmers with intrigue while investigating the philosophical conundrums and emotional paradoxes of its protagonist's condition in a spirit that owes more to
Jorge Luis Borges
than to
Fitzgerald
." Scott praised Fincher and writes "Building on the advances of pioneers like
Steven Spielberg
,
Peter Jackson
and
Robert Zemeckis
, Mr. Fincher has added a dimension of delicacy and grace to digital filmmaking" and further states: "While it stands on the shoulders of breakthroughs like
Minority Report
,
The Lord of the Rings
and
Forrest Gump
,
Benjamin Button
may be the most dazzling such hybrid yet, precisely because it is the subtlest." He also stated: "At the same time, like any other love—like any movie—it is shadowed by disappointment and fated to end."
[38]
On the other hand, Anne Hornaday of
The Washington Post
states: "There's no denying the sheer ambition and technical prowess of
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button
. What's less clear is whether it entirely earns its own inflated sense of self-importance" and further says, "It plays too safe when it should be letting its freak flag fly."
[39]
Kimberley Jones of the
Austin Chronicle
panned the film and stated, "Fincher's selling us cheekboned movie stars frolicking in bedsheets and calling it a great love. I didn't buy it for a second."
[40]
Roger Ebert
of the
Chicago Sun-Times
gave the film two and a half stars out of four, saying that it is "a splendidly made film based on a profoundly mistaken premise. ... the movie's premise devalues any relationship, makes futile any friendship or romance, and spits, not into the face of destiny, but backward into the maw of time."
[41]
Peter Bradshaw
in
The Guardian
called it "166 minutes of twee tedium", giving it one star out of five.
[42]
Cosmo Landesman
of the
Sunday Times
gave the film two out of five stars, writing: "The film's premise serves no purpose. It's a gimmick that goes on for nearly three hours ...
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button
is an anodyne Hollywood film that offers a safe and sanitised view of life and death."
[43]
James Christopher in
The Times
called it "a tedious marathon of smoke and mirrors. In terms of the basic requirements of three-reel drama the film lacks substance, credibility, a decent script and characters you might actually care for."
[44]
Derek Malcolm of London's
Evening Standard
felt that "never at any point do you feel that there's anything more to it than a very strange story traversed by a film-maker who knows what he is doing but not always why he is doing it."
[45]
