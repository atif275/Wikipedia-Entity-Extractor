Caleb Casey McGuire Affleck-Boldt
[1]

[6]

German,
[8]
English, and Swiss ancestry.

Affleck's maternal great-great-grandfather,
Heinrich Boldt
, known for the discovery of the
Curmsun Disc
, emigrated from
Prussia
in the late 1840s.
[10]
[11]
His mother was a
Radcliffe College
- and
Harvard
-educated elementary school teacher. His father worked sporadically as an auto mechanic,
[12]
[13]
a carpenter,
[14]
a
bookie
,
[15]
[16]
an electrician,
[17]
a bartender,
[18]
and a janitor at Harvard University.
[19]
In the mid-1960s, he had been a stage manager, director, writer and actor with the
Theater Company of Boston
.
[20]
[21]
[22]
During Affleck's childhood, his father was "a disaster of a drinker".
[23]
Affleck first started acting by "reenacting what was happening at home" during role play exercises at
Alateen
meetings.
[24]
After his parents divorced when he was nine, Affleck and his older brother,
Ben
, lived with their mother and visited their father weekly.
[23]
He learned to speak Spanish during a year spent traveling around Mexico with his mother and brother when he was ten.
[25]
At the time, his brother Ben was filming
The Second Voyage of the Mimi
, which was set in Mexico. The two brothers spent "all of our time together, pretty much. Obviously at school we were in different grades, but we had the same friends."
[25]
When Affleck was fourteen, his father moved to
Indio, California
, to enter a rehabilitation facility, and later worked there as an addiction counselor.
[17]
[26]
[27]
[28]
He reconnected with his father during visits to California as a teenager: "I got to know him, really, because he was sober for the first time ... The man I knew before that was just completely different."
[23]
[29]
Growing up in a politically active, liberal household in
Central Square, Cambridge
,
[15]
[30]
Affleck and his brother were surrounded by people who worked in the arts,
[31]
were regularly taken to the theater by their mother,
[32]
and were encouraged to make their own home movies.
[33]
The brothers sometimes appeared in local weather commercials and as film extras because of their mother's friendship with a local casting director.
[18]
[29]
[34]
Affleck acted in numerous high school theater productions while a student at
Cambridge Rindge and Latin School
.
[29]
[35]
He has said he "wouldn't be an actor" if not for his high school theater teacher Gerry Speca: "He kind of turned me on to acting, why it can be fun, how it can be rewarding."
[35]
At age eighteen, Affleck moved to Los Angeles for a year to pursue an acting career, and lived with his brother and their childhood friend
Matt Damon
.
[36]
Despite having "the best possible first experience" while filming
To Die For
,
[37]
he spent much of the year working as a busboy at a restaurant in
Pasadena
. He decided to move to
Washington, D.C.
, to study politics at
George Washington University
.
[18]
He soon transferred to
Columbia University
in
New York City
, where he followed the
Core Curriculum
for a total of two years.
[38]
[39]
[40]
However, he did not graduate: "I would do a semester of school, go do a movie ... Opportunities kept presenting themselves that were hard for me to turn down ... By then, I didn't really have roots at the school or a group of friends."
[37]
Career
[
edit
]
1988–2006: Early work
[
edit
]
Affleck acted professionally during his childhood due to his mother's friendship with a Cambridge-area casting director, Patty Collinge.
[37]
In addition to local weather commercials and film
extra
work,
[41]
he appeared as
Kevin Bacon
's brother in the
PBS
television film
Lemon Sky
(1988), directed by Collinge's husband Jan Egleson,
[37]
and as a young
Robert F. Kennedy
in the
ABC
miniseries
The Kennedys of Massachusetts
(1990).
[42]
These early acting experiences "meant nothing more than a day off from school" to Affleck, and he only began to consider a career as an actor when in high school.
[41]
When he later moved to Los Angeles to pursue an acting career in earnest, his first film role was as a
sociopathic
teenager in
Gus Van Sant
's 1995 satirical comedy
To Die For
. During filming in
Toronto
, Affleck shared an apartment with co-star
Joaquin Phoenix
and they became close friends.
[33]
Peter Travers
of
Rolling Stone
praised Affleck's performance, saying he "skillfully capture[s] the pang of adolescence among no-hopers."
[43]
[44]
However, Affleck then had a "disappointing" experience while making the 1996 drama
Race the Sun
and, "as soon as the film finished, I went to school."
[39]
While studying at Columbia, Affleck had a supporting role in Van Sant's
Good Will Hunting
(1997), written by his brother and their childhood friend
Matt Damon
.
[18]
[37]
Despite arranging a first meeting between Van Sant and his brother to discuss the project, Affleck was reluctant to leave college temporarily to act in the film.
[39]
He was eventually persuaded to play one of four friends living in
South Boston
– a role written specifically for him
[36]
– and improvised many of his lines.
[45]
[46]
Jay Carr of
The Boston Globe
praised the "emotional subtleties and variety" of the performances, and singled out "Casey Affleck's junior member of the quartet, dying to be taken as seriously as the others."
[47]
Following the film's success, Affleck's career opportunities did not significantly improve. At the same time, his life became exposed to the public and parts of his life became "part of pop culture and public life."
[18]
Also in 1997, he had a small role in
Kevin Smith
's
Chasing Amy
, starring his brother. He returned to university for a semester before quitting to focus on his acting career.
[39]
Affleck's career entered a "dark" period, with a series of supporting roles in critical and commercial failures.
[36]
[33]
He later remarked: "It dawned on me late that I should be selective about what I do."
[37]
In the independent comedy
Desert Blue
(1998), he starred opposite
Kate Hudson
as a small-town jock.
[48]
Peter Stack of the
San Francisco Chronicle
felt that, while "interesting", his character was "entirely underdeveloped".
[49]
In 1999, he made an uncredited cameo in the teen comedy
American Pie
[50]
and appeared as a punk rocker romantically involved with both
Gaby Hoffmann
and
Christina Ricci
's characters in the New Year's Eve ensemble comedy
200 Cigarettes
.
[51]
[52]
In the comedy
Drowning Mona
(2000), starring
Danny DeVito
, Affleck played a shy gardener suspected of murder.
[53]
Elvis Mitchell
of
The New York Times
acknowledged, in an otherwise negative review, that his role was "well played".
[54]
Also in 2000, Affleck had a small role in the comedy
Attention Shoppers
and played
Fortinbras
in
Ethan Hawke
's
Hamlet
.
[55]
He appeared as the brother of
Heather Graham
's character in the romantic comedy
Committed
(2000), with Emanuel Levy of
Variety
praising a "terrific" performance.
[56]
Also in 2001, he had a small role in
American Pie 2
and appeared in the teen
slasher film
Soul Survivors
. Robert Koehler of
Variety
found him "bland"
[57]
while Carla Meyer of the
San Francisco Chronicle
said that he did not make "much of an impression, [but may] have been too depressed to really act."
[58]
One positive experience Affleck had during this period was working with Van Sant and cinematographer
Harris Savides
on
Finding Forrester
(2000) as Van Sant's assistant and technical consultant: "Can you imagine a better film school than that? Gus is not only somebody who I love a lot but is also who has taught me, maybe more than anybody else in film."
[33]
[59]
Affleck found a degree of commercial success when he was cast in
Steven Soderbergh
's heist comedy
Ocean's Eleven
(2001), starring
George Clooney
,
Brad Pitt
and Damon. In roles Soderbergh originally intended for
Luke Wilson
and
Owen Wilson
,
[60]
Affleck and
Scott Caan
played
Mormon
brothers and wisecracking mechanics who help to rob three Las Vegas casinos simultaneously.
[61]
While it was a "great, fun social experience", Affleck spent much of his time on set "being, like, 100 feet away from the camera in the background."
[36]
He would later reprise his role in
Ocean's Twelve
(2004) and
Ocean's Thirteen
(2007).
In 2002, Affleck and Damon starred in Van Sant's experimental drama
Gerry
, playing two men who get lost while hiking in the desert.
[62]
[63]
Affleck, Damon, and Van Sant conceived of the idea and wrote the screenplay together while living in neighboring New York apartments.
[45]
The film, which had minimal dialogue, received mixed reviews.
[64]
[65]
Affleck, who rarely watches his own films,
[61]
said of
Gerry
in 2016: "That was an incredible experience. I saw one scene recently out of context at the
Telluride Film Festival
and I can't believe anyone ever sat through the whole thing. It probably works better as a whole but one scene lifted out – I thought, 'This is unbearable!'"
[37]
Also in 2002, Affleck starred with Damon and then-girlfriend
Summer Phoenix
in a
West End
stage production of
Kenneth Lonergan
's
This Is Our Youth
.
[18]
[66]
[67]
Lonergan and Affleck became friends during rehearsals,
[68]
and Affleck later acted in
workshop productions
of Lonergan's plays in New York.
[69]
[70]
Affleck in 2006
Affleck's first leading role was in 2006's little-seen independent comedy-drama
Lonesome Jim
, directed by
Steve Buscemi
. He played a depressed writer who returns from New York to live with his parents in Indiana, and begins a relationship with
Liv Tyler
's character.
[71]
Buscemi has said he knew Affleck would be able to carry the film after watching his performance in
Gerry
.
[72]
[73]
Stephen Hunter of
The Washington Post
remarked: "Affleck's interesting .. He probably can't be a star in big movies because his drawback is a voice that sounds like a snivel drawn through a wet nasal passage into a whine ... And yet in certain kinds of films – this kind – he's 100 percent authentic."
[74]
Ty Burr of
The Boston Globe
said Affleck "gets so far under the skin of this semi-charming jerk that the performance becomes both brave and aggravating."
[75]
However, Stephen Holden of
The New York Times
felt it "would be a stronger movie if Mr. Affleck had the wherewithal to bare more of the passive-aggressive rage inside ... a more resourceful actor would have used this blank slate to scrawl a thousand telling details."
[76]
Also in 2006, he had a supporting role in the romantic comedy
The Last Kiss
as a friend of
Zach Braff
's character.
[77]
2007–2012: Breakthrough
[
edit
]
Affleck had a breakthrough year in 2007, with the release of two films featuring critically acclaimed performances.
[78]
The first of these performances was in the Western drama
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford
, in which he played
Robert Ford
to
Brad Pitt
's
Jesse James
.
[79]
Affleck auditioned repeatedly for the role.
[80]
While the director
Andrew Dominik
had seen Affleck in
Gerry
,
[81]
[82]
he cast him partly because of his "beautiful-sounding voice. The voice is the thing that really gets you."
[83]
[84]
Manohla Dargis of
The New York Times
described Affleck's performance as a "revelation" which "manages to make the character seem dumb and the actor wily and smart."
[85]
Similarly, Claudia Puig of
USA Today
declared him a "real revelation [who] perfectly inhabits the role"
[86]
while Todd McCarthy of
Variety
said Affleck made "an indelible impression as the insecure, physically unprepossessing weakling."
[87]
Dana Stevens of
Slate
said "the movie belongs to Affleck [who] goes for broke in a wonderfully brave and weird performance as the craven naif Bob. Somehow he makes us want to flee this creep at top speed, even as we pray no harm will come to him." For his performance, Affleck was nominated for the
Golden Globe Award
,
Screen Actors Guild Award
and
Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor
.
While he was filming
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford
in
Calgary
, Affleck was visited by his brother, who offered him the leading role in his directorial project, the Boston crime thriller
Gone Baby Gone
(2007).
[37]
While his brother was a first-time director and in the midst of a career downturn, Affleck had confidence in the project: "I felt like I knew him better than anyone else did."
[37]
[88]
His performance, as an inexperienced private investigator tasked with finding a missing child, earned Affleck further plaudits for his acting.
[89]
Manohla Dargis of
The New York Times
said: "I'm not sure exactly when Casey Affleck became such a good actor ... Most actors want you to love them, but [he] doesn't seem to know that, or maybe he doesn't care."
[90]
Jim Ridley of
The Village Voice
described him as "a major talent coming into his own"
[91]
while Mick LaSalle of the
San Francisco Chronicle
remarked that "the revelation is Casey Affleck, who heretofore has been a rather wormy, uncharismatic screen presence."
[92]
Ty Burr of
The Boston Globe
commented: "I'd never stopped to consider Casey Affleck as a movie star before, but under his big brother's tutelage, he blooms as a leading man of richly watchable savvy and intelligence."
[93]
While
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford
and
Gone Baby Gone
were, respectively, a financial failure and a modest box office success,
[83]
[94]
Affleck's acting career was widely believed to be at a turning point.
[33]
However, he lost career momentum while directing
I'm Still Here
(2010), a divisive mockumentary about the musical career of his friend and then brother-in-law
Joaquin Phoenix
.
[33]
While Affleck later clarified that it was "a planned, staged and scripted work of fiction",
[95]
there was much media speculation during filming about whether Phoenix's public behavior was performance art or a genuine breakdown.
[96]
Claudia Puig of
USA Today
remarked that, "whether truth or folly, it's not particularly well made. Even in the midst of Phoenix's most oddball and obsessive torment, it's boring ... What, exactly, is the point of a joke that nobody really gets?"
[97]
Ty Burr of
The Boston Globe
described it as "an interesting but half-baked exercise in persona deconstruction, celebrity politics, and meta-meta-entertainment ... Parts of it are close to genius; most of it is actively torturous to watch."
[98]
Kenneth Turan of the
Los Angeles Times
said the film "turns out to be much more interesting to speculate about than to actually watch."
[99]
Reflecting on the experience in 2016, Affleck said: "We never thought people would actually think it was real ... In hindsight, we should have had a press junket and done talk shows and said how it was a mockumentary."
[70]
Affleck used his own money to fund
I'm Still Here
and, after running out of cash,
[95]
filming was paused for a month to allow him to play a Texan
serial killer
in
Michael Winterbottom
's crime drama
The Killer Inside Me
(2010).
[100]
Affleck later expressed regret over the film's graphic violence.
[70]
Philip French of
The Guardian
found him "disturbingly brilliant"
[101]
while Peter Travers of
Rolling Stone
praised "a mesmeric, implosively powerful performance."
[102]
Mark Olsen of the
Los Angeles Times
said Affleck "showcases his uncanny ability to project a person holding two thoughts in his head at once, as he often gives away nothing in his face to convey the firestorm obviously raging in his soul."
[103]
Affleck then had a supporting role in the heist comedy
Tower Heist
(2011)
[104]
and voiced a character in the 2012 animation
ParaNorman
.
[105]
2013–present: Wider recognition
[
edit
]
After spending "a big chunk of time" directing
I'm Still Here
and dealing with the subsequent backlash,
[106]
Affleck returned to regular acting work in 2013. "It was ugly for a minute ... I sort of remembered why I liked acting and I missed it."
[59]
In
David Lowery
's
Ain't Them Bodies Saints
(2013), Affleck and
Rooney Mara
starred as outlaw lovers in 1970s-era Texas.
[107]
Affleck was drawn to the opportunity to play a character who "was a much better person than anyone thought", after a string of roles as "assassins or murderers or just creeps".
[107]
Shannon M. Houston of
Paste
described him as the film's "standout actor": "Down to his very jawline, Affleck captures the physicality and feeling of a sincerely romantic outlaw."
[108]
Betsy Sharkey of the
Los Angeles Times
remarked: "Affleck plays conflicted souls so very well ... Here you wish for a criminal's redemption."
[109]
Matt Pais of the
Chicago Tribune
said: "He has great instincts when it comes to morally compromised anti-heroes, and without trolling for our sympathy, Affleck's Bob is more than just a collection of behaviors; it's a smartly considered performance."
[110]
Sebastian Doggart of
The Guardian
said he "shows himself again to be a master of the criminal outsider"
[111]
while Chuck Wilson of
The Village Voice
found him "flat-out heartbreaking".
[112]
The opportunity to act opposite
Christian Bale
in the drama
Out of the Furnace
"reinvigorated" Affleck and reminded him why he enjoyed acting.
[113]
Claudia Puig of
USA Today
found his performance as an
Iraq War
veteran dealing with
posttraumatic stress disorder
"completely captivating ... The chemistry between Bale and Affleck is powerful, intensifying the credibility of their brotherly bond."
[114]
Matt Pais of the
Chicago Tribune
said Affleck "finds something fierce and noble in uneven material and in his character's rage. He's not like any other actor in American movies."
[110]
Ann Hornaday of
The Washington Post
described the performance as "a searing portrayal of a young man who pushes himself to the punishing physical limit in search of both money and catharsis."
[115]
Manohla Dargis of
The New York Times
remarked that Affleck "can come across as intensely vulnerable on screen, which nicely works for a broken man like Rodney."
[116]
In 2014, Affleck and
Jessica Chastain
had supporting roles in
Christopher Nolan
's science fiction film
Interstellar
as the grown-up children of
Matthew McConaughey
's character,
[117]
with Todd McCarthy of
The Hollywood Reporter
describing his character as "thinly developed".
[118]
Also in 2014, Affleck and producer
John Powers Middleton
launched the production company, The Affleck/Middleton Project.
[119]
Affleck starred in three films in 2016, the first two of which underperformed financially.
[120]
[121]
In
John Hillcoat
's crime thriller
Triple 9
, Affleck played an uncorruptible detective. Mick LaSalle of the
San Francisco Chronicle
said he "arrests our attention. I wonder if any other screen actor has ever seemed so focused and so distracted at the same time. He thinks more than he says, and so we listen, trying to get the part he's leaving out."
[122]
Justin Chang of
Variety
described him as "one of the most persuasive leading men of his generation"
[123]
while Brogan Morris of
Paste
declared him "maybe Hollywood's best offbeat leading man ... Few actors can suggest so much with such quiet precision, and even here Affleck is compulsively watchable despite his undercooked character."
[124]
In Disney's disaster drama
The Finest Hours
, Affleck played a taciturn engineer on board a sinking ship.
David Sims
of
The Atlantic
said he "gives the kind of measured, thought-out performance he's so eminently capable of, even if the film isn't complex enough to rise to his level ... He animates an introverted character with subtle mental busywork whenever he's on the screen."
[125]
Sheri Linden of
The Hollywood Reporter
noted that he "manages to turn his man of few words into the movie's most compelling figure."
[126]
Affleck at the premiere of
Manchester by the Sea
in 2016
In his final role of 2016, Affleck starred as Lee Chandler, a grief-stricken loner, in
Kenneth Lonergan
's drama
Manchester by the Sea
. One of the film's producers, Matt Damon, initially intended to star in the film. When scheduling conflicts made this unfeasible, Damon agreed to step aside on the condition that he be replaced with Affleck.
[127]
Lonergan readily agreed,
[128]
remarking that Affleck was "the natural person to go to."
[129]
Affleck had close relationships with both men and had previously offered notes on early drafts of the script.
[61]
The film was a box office success,
[130]
and Affleck's performance received widespread critical praise. A.O. Scott of
The New York Times
described it as "one of the most fiercely disciplined screen performances in recent memory. [He] conveys both Lee's inner avalanche of feeling and the numb decorum that holds it back."
[131]
Kenneth Turan of the
Los Angeles Times
praised his "quietly ferocious performance, his willingness to submerge himself into this character to an almost frightening extent."
[132]
Ann Hornaday of
The Washington Post
said the film was "anchored by a quietly volcanic central performance by Casey Affleck, in a breathtaking breakout role he's long deserved."
[133]
David Fear of
Rolling Stone
stated: "He's given impressive turns before [but] the way Affleck gradually shows you the man's bone-deep grief and emotional damage makes you believe that one of this generation's finest actors has simply been waiting to be coaxed out."
[134]
Affleck won the
National Board of Review
,
Critics' Choice
,
Golden Globe
,
BAFTA
, and
Academy Award
for his performance.
After dropping out of Lowery's
Pete's Dragon
in order to star in
Manchester by the Sea
,
[61]
Affleck reteamed with the director to star opposite
Rooney Mara
in the experimental drama
A Ghost Story
, which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in early 2017.
[135]
Affleck's character dies suddenly at the outset and he spends much of the film covered by a white sheet with two eye-holes, haunting his former home. David Rooney of
The Hollywood Reporter
said Affleck's performance managed to resonate despite limited time onscreen.
[136]
Peter Debruge of
Variety
said Affleck "has never been an easy actor to read. He's a low-charisma mumbler who tends to keep his characters' emotions bottled up, making him the rare performer who can convey as much with a sheet over his head as he does without."
[137]
Jordan Hoffman of
The Guardian
described him as "cinema's finest mumbler ... I can't even tell if he's speaking or just emitting high-pitched vibrations anymore."
[138]
In 2018, Affleck starred opposite
Robert Redford
in the outlaw drama
The Old Man & the Gun
, his third collaboration with Lowery.
[139]
In 2019, he directed, wrote and starred in the survival drama
Light of My Life
.
[140]
[141]
It had its world premiere at the
Berlin International Film Festival
on February 8, 2019
[142]
and received positive reviews from film critics.
[143]
Affleck next starred in
Our Friend
, opposite
Dakota Johnson
and
Jason Segel
, directed by
Gabriela Cowperthwaite
, based upon a true story revolving around a couple, whose best friend moves in for support, following a cancer diagnosis.
[144]
which had its world premiere at the
2019 Toronto International Film Festival
.
[145]
Affleck next acted in and produced
The World to Come
, directed by
Mona Fastvold
alongside
Katherine Waterston
and
Vanessa Kirby
.
[146]
In 2023, Affleck played the supporting role of military intelligence officer
Boris Pash
in
Christopher Nolan
's biopic
Oppenheimer
.
[147]
Personal life
[
edit
]
Relationships and family
[
edit
]
Affleck was introduced to actress
Summer Phoenix
by her brother,
Joaquin
, in the late 1990s.
[18]
[148]
They began dating in 2000,
[149]
and acted together in both the 2000 film
Committed
[150]
and a 2002 stage production of
This Is Our Youth
.
[151]
The couple became engaged in January 2004
[148]
and married on June 3, 2006, in Savannah, Georgia.
[152]
They have two sons born in 2004 and 2007.
[153]
On August 1, 2017, Phoenix officially filed for divorce, citing "irreconcilable differences",
[154]
and it was finalized later that year.
[155]
Affleck has said it was an amicable divorce and that they remain friends.
[23]
He has been in a relationship with actress
Caylee Cowan
since January 2021.
[156]
Alcoholism
[
edit
]
In a 2016 interview, Affleck said that he had been sober for "almost three years ... My father was a disaster of a drinker, my grandmother was an alcoholic, my brother spent some time in rehab – it's in our genes."
[23]
Political views
[
edit
]
In 2008, Affleck filmed an episode of documentary series
4Real
, in which he visited the
Pawnee Nation of Oklahoma
, and remarked upon the progress they had made due largely to "their own resourcefulness and determination and their character, and not because of the goodness of our collective heart."
[157]
During the
2016 presidential campaign
, Affleck supported
Hillary Clinton
[33]
[158]
and characterized
Donald Trump
as "a dangerous fool".
[61]
[159]
In 2017, multiple financial contributions to Trump were made by Affleck's production company, which he co-founded with
John Powers Middleton
. In a statement, Affleck denied involvement: "I had no knowledge of it, was never asked, and never would have authorized it ... The policies of the Trump administration, and the values they represent, are antithetical to everything I believe in."
[160]
Sexual harassment allegations
[
edit
]
Affleck has settled two sexual harassment lawsuits out of court for an undisclosed amount.
[161]
In 2010, two of his former co-workers from
I'm Still Here
filed civil lawsuits against Affleck.
Amanda White
, one of the film's producers, sued Affleck for $2 million with multiple complaints including
sexual harassment
and breach of oral contract.
[162]
She detailed numerous "uninvited and unwelcome sexual advances" in the workplace. White alleged that Affleck refused to honor the terms of the production agreement, including her fee, in retaliation.
[162]
The film's cinematographer, Magdalena Gorka, sued Affleck for $2.25 million with multiple complaints including intentional infliction of emotional distress and breach of oral contract.
[163]
[164]
Gorka alleged that she had been subjected to "routine instances" of sexual harassment by crew members including
Antony Langdon
, "within the presence and with the active encouragement of Affleck."
[163]
Initially, Affleck denied the allegations and threatened to countersue.
[165]
No countersuits were filed.
[161]
His lawyer claimed, "Both women left the film in April 2009 and both were refused when they wanted to return", and "there was no mention of sexual harassment before June [2010]."
[166]
The film's associate producer Nicole Acacio and an unnamed female editor both defended Affleck's conduct on set.
[167]
The lawsuits were later settled out of court.
[168]
Both women received credit for their work on the project; no details of any financial settlement were released.
[169]
Casey Affleck in 2018
Affleck addressed the allegations in a 2016 interview with
The New York Times
, stating: "It was settled to the satisfaction of all. I was hurt and upset — I am sure all were — but I am over it. It was an unfortunate situation — mostly for the innocent bystanders of the families of those involved."
[170]
The allegations and lawsuits attracted scrutiny during the
2016–17 film awards season
, when Affleck was recognized for his performance in
Manchester by the Sea
, which culminated in further controversy following his Best Actor win at the
89th Academy Awards
.
[171]
[172]
[173]
The following year, amidst the
Me Too movement
, Affleck withdrew from presenting the award for
Best Actress
at the
90th Academy Awards
.
[174]
In a 2018 interview with the Associated Press, Affleck discussed the lawsuits and allegations in light of the Me Too movement.
[175]
He characterized his behavior at the time of the lawsuits as defensive and said he has since worked to understand his own culpability.
[175]
He acknowledged that the set of
I'm Still Here
was "an unprofessional environment" and that "I contributed to that unprofessional environment and I tolerated that kind of behavior from other people and I wish that I hadn't. And I regret a lot of that ... I behaved in a way and allowed others to behave in a way that was really unprofessional. And I'm sorry."
[175]
Philanthropy
[
edit
]
Affleck has been a
vegan
since 1995.
[176]
He has been involved with
animal rights
campaigns for both
People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals
(PETA)
[177]
[178]
[179]
and
Farm Sanctuary
.
[180]
In 2017, Affleck supported the 37th Annual National Veterans Wheelchair Games
[181]
hosted by
Paralyzed Veterans of America
. In January 2019, he attended the fourth annual
Veterans Awards
as a presenter.
[182]
In June 2020, Affleck, with his mother Christine, founded a fundraising effort, Stories from Tomorrow. The initiative was co-sponsored by
Room to Read
,
WriteGirl
and New Earth, an organization where Affleck is a board member. 'Stories from Tomorrow' matches original writing by children ages 5–18 with celebrities who read their work, which is then presented in video form. The money raised will be used to ensure that children around the world have access to education and food.
