Early life and education
Jessica Michelle Chastain was born on March 24, 1977, in
Sacramento, California
,
[1]
[2]
[3]
to Jerri Renee Hastey (née Chastain) and rock musician Michael Monasterio.
[4]
[5]
Her parents were both teenagers when she was born. Chastain is reluctant to publicly discuss her family background. She was estranged from Monasterio, who died in 2013, and has stated that no father is listed on her birth certificate.
[4]
[5]
Chastain has two sisters and two brothers. Her younger sister, Juliet, committed suicide in 2003 following years of drug addiction.
[6]
Chastain was raised in Sacramento by her mother and stepfather, Michael Hastey, a firefighter.
[2]
[7]
Her family struggled financially.
[8]
Chastain has said that her stepfather was the first person to make her feel secure.
[5]
She shares a close bond with her maternal grandmother, Marilyn, and credits her as someone who "always believed in me".
[7]
[9]
The
Juilliard School
in New York City, where Chastain studied acting
Chastain developed an interest in acting at age seven, after her grandmother took her to a production of
Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat
.
[2]
She would regularly put on amateur shows with other children, and considered herself to be their artistic director.
[7]
As a student at the
El Camino Fundamental High School
in Sacramento, Chastain struggled academically.
[4]
[10]
She was a loner and considered herself a misfit in school, eventually finding an outlet in the performing arts.
[11]
She has described how she used to miss school to read
Shakespeare
,
[12]
whose plays she became enamored with after attending the
Oregon Shakespeare Festival
with her classmates.
[13]
With too many absences during her senior year in school, Chastain did not qualify for graduation, but later obtained an
adult diploma
.
[10]
She later attended
Sacramento City College
from 1996 to 1997, during which she was a member of the institution's debate team.
[14]
Describing her early childhood, she recalled:
I [grew up] with a single mother who worked very hard to put food on our table. We did not have money. There were many nights when we had to go to sleep without eating. It was a very difficult upbringing. Things weren't easy for me growing up.
[15]
In 1998, Chastain finished her education at the
American Academy of Dramatic Arts
and made her professional stage debut as
Juliet
in a production of
Romeo and Juliet
staged by
TheatreWorks
, a company in the
San Francisco Bay Area
.
[16]
[17]
[18]
The production led her to audition for the
Juilliard School
in New York City, where she was soon accepted and granted a scholarship funded by actor
Robin Williams
.
[7]
[10]
In her first year at the school, Chastain suffered from anxiety and was worried about being dropped from the program, spending most of her time reading and watching films.
[7]
[18]
She later remarked that her participation in a successful production of
The Seagull
during her second year helped build her confidence.
[18]
She graduated from the school with a
Bachelor of Fine Arts
degree in 2003.
[18]
Career
2004–2010: Early work
Shortly before graduating from Juilliard, Chastain attended an event for final-year students in Los Angeles, where she was signed to a
talent holding deal
by the television producer
John Wells
.
[19]
She relocated to Los Angeles and started auditioning for jobs.
[19]
She initially found the process difficult, which she believed was due to other people finding her difficult to categorize as a redhead with an unconventional look.
[20]
In her television debut,
The WB
network's
2004 pilot remake
of the 1960s
gothic
soap opera
Dark Shadows
, she was cast as
Carolyn Stoddard
.
[21]
The pilot was directed by
P. J. Hogan
, but the series was never picked up for broadcast.
[21]
Later that year, she appeared as a guest performer on the medical drama series
ER
playing a woman she described as "psychotic", which led to her getting more unusual parts such as accident victims or characters with mental illness.
[19]
[20]
She went on to appear in such roles in a few other television series from 2004 to 2007, including
Veronica Mars
(2004),
Close to Home
(2006),
Blackbeard
(2006), and
Law & Order: Trial by Jury
(2005–06).
[22]
Chastain at the 2010
Mill Valley Film Festival
In 2004, Chastain took on the role of Anya, a virtuous young woman, in a
Williamstown Theatre Festival
production of
Anton Chekhov
's play
The Cherry Orchard
in Massachusetts, starring with
Michelle Williams
.
[23]
Also that year, she worked with
Playwrights Horizons
on a production of
Richard Nelson
's
Rodney's Wife
as the daughter of a troubled middle-aged film actor. Her performance was not well received by the critic
Ben Brantley
of
The New York Times
, who thought that she "somehow seems to keep losing color as the evening progresses".
[24]
While working on the play, she was recommended by Nelson to
Al Pacino
, who was looking for an actress to star in his production of
Oscar Wilde
's tragedy
Salome
.
[19]
The play tells the tragic story of its titular character's sexual exploration. In the play, Salome is a 16-year-old, but Chastain, aged 29 then, was cast for the part.
[25]
The play was staged in 2006 at the
Wadsworth Theatre
in Los Angeles, and Chastain later remarked that it helped bring her to the attention of several casting directors.
[25]
[26]
Writing for
Variety
, the critic Steven Oxman criticized her portrayal in the play: "Chastain is so ill-at-ease with Salome, not quite certain whether she's a capable seductress or a whiny, wealthy brat; she doesn't flesh out either choice".
[26]
Chastain made her film debut in 2008 as the titular character in
Dan Ireland
's drama
Jolene
, based on a short story by
E. L. Doctorow
inspired by
Dolly Parton
's song "
Jolene
".
[27]
It follows the life of a sexually abused teenager over the course of a decade. Chastain's performance was praised by a reviewer for the
New York Observer
, who considered her as the only notable aspect of the production.
[28]
[29]
She won a Best Actress award at the
Seattle International Film Festival
.
[30]
In 2009, she had a minor role in
Stolen
(2009), a mystery-thriller film with a limited theatrical release.
[31]
[32]
Also in 2009, she played the part of
Desdemona
in
The Public Theatre
production of Shakespeare's tragedy
Othello
, co-starring
John Ortiz
as
the title character
and
Philip Seymour Hoffman
as
Iago
.
[33]
Writing for
The New Yorker
,
Hilton Als
commended Chastain for finding "a beautiful maternal depth" in her role.
[34]
In 2010, Chastain starred in
John Madden
's dramatic thriller
The Debt
, portraying a young
Mossad
agent sent to
East Berlin
in the 1960s to capture a former
Nazi
doctor who carried out medical experiments in
concentration camps
.
[35]
She shared her role with
Helen Mirren
, with the two actresses portraying the character at different phases of her life.
[35]
They worked together before filming to perfect the voice and mannerisms of the character and make them consistent. Chastain took classes in German and
Krav Maga
, and studied books about the Nazi doctor
Josef Mengele
and Mossad history.
[35]
William Thomas of
Empire
termed the film a "smart, tense, well-acted thriller", and noted that Chastain "pulses with strength and vulnerability" in her part.
[36]
She also appeared as Mary Debenham in an episode of the British television series
Agatha Christie's Poirot
, based on
Agatha Christie
's 1934 novel
Murder on the Orient Express
.
[37]
2011–2013: Breakthrough and rise to prominence
Chastain attending the premiere of
Coriolanus
at the
2011 Berlin International Film Festival
After struggling for a breakthrough in film, Chastain had six releases in 2011 and received wide recognition for several of them.
[19]
[38]
The first of the roles was as the wife of
Michael Shannon
's character in
Jeff Nichols
'
Take Shelter
, a drama about a troubled father who tries to protect his family from what he believes is an impending storm. The film was screened at the 2011
Sundance Film Festival
, and critic Tim Robey of
The Daily Telegraph
noted how much Chastain's supporting part aided the narrative.
[39]
In
Coriolanus
, an adaptation of the
Shakespearean
tragedy
from actor-director
Ralph Fiennes
, she played
Virgilia
.
[40]
Her next role was opposite
Brad Pitt
, as the loving mother of three children in
Terrence Malick
's experimental drama
The Tree of Life
, which she had filmed in 2008.
[41]
[42]
Chastain signed on to the film without receiving a traditional screenplay from Malick, and she improvised several scenes and dialogues with Pitt.
[43]
She considered her part to be "the embodiment of grace and the spirit world"; in preparation, she practiced meditation, studied paintings of the
Madonna
, and read poems by
Thomas Aquinas
.
[43]
The film premiered at the
2011 Cannes Film Festival
to a polarized reception from the audience, though it was praised by critics and won the
Palme d'Or
.
[44]
The critic
Justin Chang
termed the film a "hymn to the glory of creation, an exploratory, often mystifying [...] poem" and credited Chastain for playing her part with "heartrending vulnerability".
[45]
Chastain's biggest success of the year came with the drama
The Help
, co-starring
Viola Davis
,
Octavia Spencer
and
Emma Stone
, which was based on
Kathryn Stockett
's
novel of the same name
. She played Celia Foote, an aspiring socialite in 1960s
Jackson, Mississippi
, who develops a friendship with her Black maid (played by Spencer). Chastain was drawn to Foote's antiracist stand, and connected with her energy and enthusiasm; in preparation, she watched the films of
Marilyn Monroe
and researched the history of
Tunica, Mississippi
, where her character was raised.
[46]
The Help
grossed $216 million at the box office to become her most widely seen film to that point.
[47]
[48]
Manohla Dargis
of
The New York Times
praised the chemistry between Chastain and Spencer, and
Roger Ebert
credited her for being "unaffected and infectious".
[49]
The ensemble of
The Help
won the
Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Cast
, and Chastain received
Academy
,
BAFTA
,
Golden Globe
and
SAG Award
nominations for Best Supporting Actress, all of which she lost to Spencer.
[7]
[50]
[51]
Chastain's final two roles of the year were in
Wilde Salomé
, a documentary based on her 2006 production of
Salome
,
[52]
and the critically panned crime-thriller
Texas Killing Fields
.
[53]
Her film roles in 2011, particularly in
The Help
,
Take Shelter
and
The Tree of Life
, won her awards from several critics' organizations.
[54]
Two of Chastain's films in 2012 premiered at the
65th Cannes Film Festival
— the animated comedy
Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted
and the crime drama
Lawless
.
[55]
In the former, which marked the third installment in the
Madagascar
series, she voiced Gia the Jaguar with an Italian accent.
[56]
With global revenues of $747 million, the film ranks as her highest-grossing release.
[57]
[48]
In
Lawless
, based on
Matt Bondurant
's
Prohibition
-era novel
The Wettest County in the World
, she played a dancer who becomes embroiled in a conflict between three
bootlegging
brothers (played by
Shia LaBeouf
,
Tom Hardy
, and
Jason Clarke
).
[58]
The film received generally positive reviews, with
Richard Corliss
finding Chastain to be filled with "poised, seductive gravity".
[59]
[60]
In an experimental biopic of the author
C. K. Williams
, entitled
The Color of Time
(2012), directed by the
New York University
students of actor
James Franco
, she played the mother of the young Williams.
[61]
[62]
Chastain at the
2012 Cannes Film Festival
where two of her films —
Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted
and
Lawless
— were screened
A short part Chastain had filmed for Terrence Malick's
To the Wonder
(2012) was edited out of the final film, and due to scheduling conflicts, she dropped out of the action films
Oblivion
and
Iron Man 3
(both 2013).
[63]
She instead made her
Broadway
debut in a revival of the 1947 play
The Heiress
, playing the role of Catherine Sloper, a naïve young girl who transforms into a powerful woman.
[64]
Chastain was reluctant to take the role, fearing the anxiety she had faced during her early stage performances.
[64]
She ultimately agreed after finding a connection to Sloper, explaining: "she's painfully uncomfortable and I used to be that".
[64]
The production was staged at the
Walter Kerr Theatre
from November 2012 to February 2013.
[65]
Ben Brantley
of
The New York Times
was disappointed in Chastain's performance, writing that she was "oversignaling the thoughts within" and that her delivery of dialogue was sometimes flat.
[65]
The Heiress
emerged as a
sleeper hit
at the box office.
[66]
Kathryn Bigelow
's thriller
Zero Dark Thirty
was Chastain's final film release of 2012. It is a partly fictionalized account of the
nearly decade-long manhunt
for
Al-Qaeda
leader
Osama bin Laden
after the
September 11 attacks
in 2001. She played Maya Harris, a
CIA
intelligence analyst who helps kill bin Laden. Chastain was unable to meet the intelligence analyst on whom her character was based, so she relied on the research done by the film's screenwriter
Mark Boal
.
[67]
The difficult subject matter made it unpleasant for her to film; she suffered from depression during production, and once walked off the set in tears because she was unable to continue.
[67]
Zero Dark Thirty
was critically acclaimed, albeit
controversial
for its scenes of
torture
that were shown providing useful intelligence in the search for bin Laden.
[68]
[69]
Roger Ebert took note of Chastain's versatility, and likened her ability and range to that of
Meryl Streep
.
[70]
Peter Travers
of
Rolling Stone
wrote, "Chastain is a marvel. She plays Maya like a gathering storm in an indelible, implosive performance that cuts so deep we can feel her nerve endings."
[71]
She won the
Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Drama
and received
Academy
,
BAFTA
and
SAG
nominations for Best Actress.
[7]
[72]
Chastain took on the lead role of a musician who is forced to care for her boyfriend's troubled nieces in the horror film
Mama
(2013), directed by
Andy Muschietti
. She was drawn to the idea of playing a woman drastically different from the "perfect mother" roles she had previously played, and she based her character's look on the singer
Alice Glass
.
[21]
The critic
Richard Roeper
considered her performance to be proof of her being one of the finest actors of her generation.
[73]
During the film's opening weekend in North America, Chastain became the first performer in fifteen years to have leading roles in the top two films (
Mama
and
Zero Dark Thirty
) at the box office.
[74]
She then starred as the titular character of a depressed woman who separates from her husband (played by
James McAvoy
) following a tragic incident in the drama
The Disappearance of Eleanor Rigby
(2013), which she also produced.
[75]
The writer-director
Ned Benson
initially wrote the story from the perspective of Rigby's husband, then wrote a separate version from Rigby's perspective at the insistence of Chastain.
[76]
Three versions of the film —
Him
,
Her
, and
Them
— were released.
[76]
[77]
It did not find a wide audience,
[78]
but the critic
A. O. Scott
praised Chastain for "short-circuit[ing] conventional distinctions between tough and vulnerable, showing exquisite control even when her character is losing it, and keeping her balance even when the movie pitches and rolls toward melodrama".
[79]
2014–2020: Career fluctuations and expansion
Chastain attending the premiere of
Miss Julie
at the
2014 Toronto International Film Festival
Chastain appeared in three films in 2014. She played the titular character in
Miss Julie
, a film adaptation of
August Strindberg
's 1888
play of the same name
, from director
Liv Ullmann
.
[80]
It tells the tragic tale of a sexually repressed
Anglo-Irish
aristocrat who wishes to sleep with her father's valet (
Colin Farrell
).
[81]
She was drawn to Ullmann's feminist take on the subject.
[82]
The film only received a limited theatrical release.
[83]
While filming
Miss Julie
in Ireland, she received the script for
Christopher Nolan
's science fiction film
Interstellar
(2014).
[84]
With a budget of $165 million, the high-profile production, co-starring
Matthew McConaughey
and
Anne Hathaway
, was filmed mostly using
IMAX
cameras.
[85]
[86]
Chastain played the adult daughter of McConaughey's character; she was drawn to the project for the emotional heft she found in the father-daughter pair.
[87]
Drew McWeeny of
HitFix
took note of how much Chastain had stood out in her supporting role.
[88]
Interstellar
grossed over $701 million worldwide to rank as her highest-grossing live-action film to date.
[48]
[85]
In her final release of 2014, Chastain starred in the
J. C. Chandor
-directed crime drama
A Most Violent Year
. Set in New York City in 1981, the year in which the
city had the highest crime rate
, the film tells the story of a heating-oil company owner (
Oscar Isaac
) and his ruthless wife (Chastain).
[89]
In preparation, she researched the period and worked with a dialect coach to speak in a Brooklyn accent.
[90]
She collaborated with the film's costume designer to work on her character's wardrobe, and contacted
Armani
which provided her with clothing of the period.
[90]
Mark Kermode
of
The Observer
found Chastain to be "terrific" in a part inspired by
Lady Macbeth
's character, and
Mick LaSalle
of the
San Francisco Chronicle
described her portrayal as "the embodiment of a
nouveau riche
New York woman of the era".
[91]
[92]
She received a Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actress nomination for it.
[93]
For her work in 2014, the
Broadcast Film Critics Association
honored Chastain with a special achievement award.
[94]
In 2015, Chastain took on the part of a
commander
in
Ridley Scott
's science fiction film
The Martian
. Starring
Matt Damon
as a botanist who is stranded on Mars by a team of astronauts commanded by Chastain's character, the film is based on
Andy Weir
's novel of the
same name
. Chastain met with astronauts at the
Jet Propulsion Laboratory
and the
Johnson Space Center
, and modeled her role on
Tracy Caldwell Dyson
, with whom she spent time in Houston.
[95]
The Martian
became her second film to gross over $600 million in two consecutive years.
[48]
[96]
Chastain next starred as a woman who plots with her brother (
Tom Hiddleston
) to terrorize his new bride (
Mia Wasikowska
) in
Guillermo del Toro
's
gothic romance
Crimson Peak
. She approached the villainous part with empathy, and in preparation read
graveyard poetry
and watched the films
Rebecca
(1940) and
What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?
(1962).
[95]
Del Toro cast Chastain to lend accessibility to a part he considered "
psychopathic
", but Peter Debruge of
Variety
found her "alarmingly miscast" and criticized her for failing to effectively convey her character's insecurity and ruthlessness.
[95]
[97]
Conversely, David Sims of
Slate
praised her for portraying her character's "jealous intensity to the hilt".
[98]
After playing a series of intense roles, Chastain actively looked for a light-hearted part.
[99]
She found it in the ensemble fantasy film
The Huntsman: Winter's War
(2016), which served as both a sequel and a prequel to the 2012 film
Snow White and the Huntsman
. She was drawn to the idea of playing a warrior whose abilities were on par with those of the male lead, but the film flopped both critically and commercially.
[99]
[100]
Chastain next starred as the titular character, a lobbyist, in the political thriller
Miss Sloane
, which reunited her with John Madden.
[99]
[101]
She read the novel
Capitol Punishment
by disgraced former lobbyist
Jack Abramoff
to research the practice of lobbying in America, and met with female lobbyists to study their mannerisms and sense of style.
[102]
Hailing her as "one of the best actresses on the planet", Peter Travers commended Chastain for successfully drawing the audience into Sloane's life, and Justin Chang termed her performance "a tour de force of rhetorical precision and tightly coiled emotional intensity".
[103]
[104]
She received a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress in a Drama.
[105]
Also in 2016, Chastain launched the production company
Freckle Films
, headed by a team of female executives.
[99]
[106]
Chastain at the
2016 Cannes Film Festival
Chastain began 2017 by serving as the executive producer and providing the narration for
I Am Jane Doe
, a documentary on
sex trafficking
.
[107]
In an effort to work with more female filmmakers, Chastain starred in two projects directed by women —
Niki Caro
's
The Zookeeper's Wife
and
Susanna White
's
Woman Walks Ahead
.
[108]
In the former, an adaptation of
Diane Ackerman
's non-fiction book of the
same name
, she co-starred with
Johan Heldenbergh
as the real-life Polish zookeepers
Jan and Antonina Żabiński
who saved many human and animal lives during
World War II
.
[106]
[109]
The film received mixed reviews, but
Stephen Holden
took note of how Chastain's "watchful, layered performance" empowered the film.
[110]
[111]
Woman Walks Ahead
tells the story of the 19th-century activist
Catherine Weldon
, who served as an adviser to the
Sioux
chieftain
Sitting Bull
prior to the
Wounded Knee Massacre
. She was interested in portraying a role that young girls could look up to for inspiration, and provided off-screen inputs to avoid a
white savior narrative
.
[112]
Chastain portrayed
Molly Bloom
, a former skier who ran a high-profile gambling operation that led to her arrest by the
FBI
, in
Aaron Sorkin
's directorial debut,
Molly's Game
(2017). She took the part due to her desire to work with Sorkin, whose writing she admired.
[113]
Instead of relying on Bloom's public persona, she met Bloom personally to explore her character's flaws and vulnerabilities. She also researched the world of
underground poker
and interviewed some of Bloom's customers.
[113]
Peter Debruge hailed her role as "one of the screen's great female parts", and credited its success to both Sorkin's script and Chastain's "stratospheric talent."
[114]
She received her fifth Golden Globe nomination for it.
[115]
In 2018, she hosted an episode of the television sketch comedy show
Saturday Night Live
and voiced the
virtual reality
production
Spheres: Songs of Spacetime
.
[116]
[117]
She had filmed a part in
Xavier Dolan
's ensemble drama
The Death & Life of John F. Donovan
, but her scenes were deleted from the final cut as Dolan found her role incompatible to the story.
[118]
In the superhero film
Dark Phoenix
(2019), which marked the twelfth installment in the
X-Men
series
, Chastain took on the role of an evil alien due to its focus on female characters.
[119]
Peter Bradshaw
of
The Guardian
considered it to be "a waste of her talents", and the film registered poor box office returns.
[120]
[121]
She reteamed with Andy Muschietti in
It Chapter Two
, the sequel to his 2017 horror film
It
, based on
Stephen King
's
novel
. She played the adult
Beverly Marsh
(a woman in an abusive marriage), sharing the role with
Sophia Lillis
. Filming proved challenging for Chastain, as Muschietti preferred the usage of practical effects to
computer-generated imagery
; one particular scene required her to be covered in 4,500 U.S. gallons (17,000 liters) of fake blood.
