Early life and education
Damon was born in
Cambridge, Massachusetts
on October 8, 1970,
[1]
[2]
the second son of Kent Telfer Damon (1942–2017), a stockbroker, and Nancy Carlsson-Paige (b. 1946), an early childhood education professor at
Lesley University
.
[3]
[4]
[5]
His father had English and Scottish ancestry, while his mother is of Finnish and Swedish descent; her family surname had been changed from
Pajari
to Paige.
[6]
[7]
[8]
Damon and his family moved to
Newton
for two years. His parents divorced when he was two years old, and he and his brother returned with their mother to Cambridge,
[4]
[9]
where they lived in a six-family communal house.
[10]
[11]
His brother, Kyle, is a sculptor and artist.
[4]
[12]
Damon has said that, as a teenager, he had felt lonely, as if he did not belong,
[10]
and that his mother's by-the-book approach to child-rearing
[10]
had made it hard for him to define his own identity.
[10]
Damon attended Cambridge Alternative School and
Cambridge Rindge and Latin School
, and was a good student.
[13]
He acted in several high-school theater productions,
[4]
and has credited his drama teacher, Gerry Speca, as having had an important artistic influence on him—-although noting wryly that Speca had given
Ben Affleck
(Damon’s close friend and schoolmate) the "biggest roles and longest speeches".
[13]
[14]
[nb 1]
He attended
Harvard University
as a member of the class of 1992, residing in
Lowell House
, but left before receiving his degree to take a lead role in the film
Geronimo: An American Legend
. While at Harvard, as an exercise for an English class, Damon wrote an essay in the form of a
film treatment
which was later developed into the screenplay
Good Will Hunting
(for which he received an Academy Award).
[16]
At Harvard, Damon was a member of
the Delphic Club
, one of the university’s elite
Final Clubs
. In 2013, he was awarded the Harvard Arts Medal.

1988–1999: Early work and breakthrough
Damon entered
Harvard
in 1988,
[18]
[nb 2]
where he appeared in student theater plays, such as
Burn This
and
A... My Name is Alice
.
[20]
[21]
Later, he made his film debut at the age of 18, with a single line of dialogue in the
romantic comedy
Mystic Pizza
.
[22]
As a student at Harvard, he acted in small roles such as in the
TNT
original film
Rising Son
and the ensemble prep-school drama
School Ties
.
[23]
He left the school in 1992, a semester (12 credits) shy of completing his Bachelor of Arts in English to feature in
Geronimo: An American Legend
[20]
[24]
in Los Angeles, erroneously expecting the movie to become a big success.
[20]
[nb 3]
Damon next appeared as an
opiate
-addicted soldier in 1996's
Courage Under Fire
, for which he lost 40 pounds (18 kg) in 100 days
[22]
[26]
on a self-prescribed diet and fitness regimen.
Courage Under Fire
gained him critical notice, when
The Washington Post
labeled his performance "impressive".
[27]
Damon during filming for
The Talented Mr. Ripley
in 1999
During the early 1990s,
Damon and Affleck
wrote
Good Will Hunting
(1997), a screenplay about a young mathematics genius, an extension of a screenplay he wrote for an assignment at Harvard, having integrated advice from director
Rob Reiner
, screenwriter
William Goldman
, and writer/director
Kevin Smith
.
[28]
He asked Affleck to perform the scenes with him in front of the class and, when Damon later moved into Affleck's Los Angeles apartment, they began working on the script more seriously.
[29]
The film, which they wrote mainly during improvisation sessions, was set partly in their hometown of Cambridge, and drew from their own experiences.
[30]
[31]
They sold the screenplay to
Castle Rock
in 1994, but after a conflict with the company, they convinced
Miramax
to purchase the script.
[32]
[33]
The film received critical praise; Quentin Curtis of
The Daily Telegraph
found "real wit and vigour, and some depth" in their writing and Emanuel Levy of
Variety
wrote of Damon's acting, "[he] gives a charismatic performance in a demanding role that's bound to catapult him to stardom. Perfectly cast, he makes the aching, step-by-step transformation of Will realistic and credible."
[34]
[35]
It received nine
Academy Awards
nominations, including
Best Actor
for Damon; he and Affleck won the
Oscar
and
Golden Globe Award for Best Screenplay
.
[36]
He and Affleck were each paid salaries of $600,000, while the film grossed over $225 million at the worldwide box office.
[37]
[38]
The two later parodied their roles from the film in Kevin Smith's 2001 movie
Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back
.
[39]
Speaking of his "overnight success" through
Good Will Hunting
, Damon said by that time he had been working in the cinema for 11 years, but still found the change "nearly indescribable—going from total obscurity to walking down a street in New York and having everybody turn and look".
[40]
Before the film, Damon played the lead in the critically acclaimed drama
The Rainmaker
(1997), where he was recognized by the
Los Angeles Times
as "a talented young actor on the brink of stardom."
[41]
For the role, Damon regained most of the weight he had lost for
Courage Under Fire
.
[42]
After meeting Damon on the set of
Good Will Hunting
, director
Steven Spielberg
cast him in the brief title role in the 1998
World War II
film
Saving Private Ryan
.
[43]
He co-starred with
Edward Norton
in the 1998 poker film
Rounders
, where he plays a reformed gambler in law school who must return to playing big stakes poker to help a friend pay off loan sharks. Despite meager earnings at the box-office, it is now considered one of the greatest poker movies of all time.
[44]
Damon then portrayed antihero
Tom Ripley
in
The Talented Mr. Ripley
(1999), a role for which he lost 11 kilograms (25 lb). Damon said that he wanted to display his character's humanity and honesty on screen despite his criminal actions.
[45]
An adaptation of
Patricia Highsmith
's 1955
novel of same name
, the film costarred
Jude Law
,
Gwyneth Paltrow
, and
Cate Blanchett
, and received praise from critics.
[46]
"Damon outstandingly conveys his character's slide from innocent enthusiasm into cold calculation", according to
Variety
magazine.
[47]
He played a
fallen angel
who discusses
pop culture
as intellectual subject matter with Affleck in
Dogma
(1999).
[48]
The film received generally positive reviews, but proved controversial among religious groups who deemed it blasphemous.
[49]
2000–2008: Worldwide recognition
In 2000, along with
Ben Affleck
and producers
Chris Moore
and
Sean Bailey
, Damon founded the production company
LivePlanet
, through which the four created the
Emmy
-nominated documentary series
Project Greenlight
to find and fund worthwhile film projects from novice filmmakers.
[50]
[51]
The company produced and founded the short-lived mystery-hybrid series
Push, Nevada
, among other projects.
[52]
Damon in 2001
Damon's attempts at leading characters in romantic dramas such as 2000's
All the Pretty Horses
and
The Legend of Bagger Vance
were commercially and critically unsuccessful.
[37]
Variety
said of his work in
All the Pretty Horses
: "[Damon] just doesn't quite seem like a young man who's spent his life amidst the dust and dung of a Texas cattle ranch. Nor does he strike any sparks with
[Penelope] Cruz
."
[53]
He was similarly deemed "uncomfortable being the center" of
Robert Redford
's
The Legend of Bagger Vance
by Peter Rainer of
New York
magazine.
[54]
During this period, Damon joined two lucrative film series—
Ocean's Trilogy
(2001–2007) and
Bourne
(2002–2016)—and produced the television series
Project Greenlight
(2001–2005, 2015). In the former's first installment,
Steven Soderbergh
's 2001 ensemble film
Ocean's Eleven
, which is a remake of the
Rat Pack
's
Ocean's 11
(1960), he co-starred as thief Linus Caldwell.
[22]
The role was originally meant for
Mark Wahlberg
, who refused it in favor of other projects.
[55]
The film was successful at the box-office, grossing $450 million from a budget of $83 million.
[56]
Damon, alongside Affleck and others, produced the documentary series
Project Greenlight
, aired on
HBO
and later
Bravo
, which helps newcomers develop their first film. The series was nominated for the
Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Reality Program
in 2002, 2004, and 2005.
[57]
Damon later said that he and Affleck felt proud that the show helped launch the careers of several directors; Damon later served as the executive producer of a number of projects directed by the winners of the show.
[58]
Damon began 2002 with writing and starring in
Gerry
, a drama about two friends who forget to bring water and food when they go hiking in a desert. The reviews for the film were generally positive, but it was a box-office failure.
[59]
[60]
He then played
amnesiac
assassin
Jason Bourne
in
Doug Liman
's action thriller
The Bourne Identity
(2002). Liman considered several actors for the role before he cast Damon.
[61]
Damon insisted on performing many of the stunts himself, undergoing three months of extensive training in stunt work, the use of weapons, boxing, and
eskrima
.
[62]
Damon said that before
The Bourne Identity
he was jobless for six months, and many of his films during that period under-performed at the box-office. He doubted the film's financial prospects, but it proved a commercial success.
[60]
Reviews for the film were also positive;
[63]
Roger Ebert
praised it for its ability to absorb the viewer in its "spycraft" and "Damon's ability to be focused and sincere".
[64]
For his role,
Entertainment Weekly
named Damon among "the decade's best mixer of brawn and brains."
[65]

The Bourne Ultimatum
in 2007
Damon voiced the role of Spirit in the animated film
Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron
(2002) and later played a
conjoined twin
in
Stuck on You
(2003), which received a mixed critical reception.
[66]
His major releases in 2004 included starring roles in the sequels
The Bourne Supremacy
and
Ocean's Twelve
. Both films earned more than $280 million at the box-office.
[67]
[68]
In a review for
The Bourne Supremacy
,
BBC
's Nev Pierce called the film "a brisk, engrossing and intelligent thriller", adding, "Damon is one hell of an action hero. He does a lot with very little, imbuing his limited dialogue with both rage and sorrow, looking harder and more haunted as the picture progresses".
[69]
For the film, he earned an
Empire Award for Best Actor
; the award's presenter
Empire
attributed Damon's win to his "astute, underplayed performance, through which he totally eschews movie star vanity".
[70]
He played a fictionalized version of
Wilhelm Grimm
alongside
Heath Ledger
in
Terry Gilliam
's fantasy adventure
The Brothers Grimm
(2005), which was a critically panned commercial failure;
[37]
The Washington Post
concluded, "Damon, constantly flashing his newscaster's teeth and flaunting a fake, '
Masterpiece Theatre
' dialect, comes across like someone who got lost on the way to an audition for a high school production of
The Pirates of Penzance
."
[71]
Later in 2005, he appeared as an
energy analyst
in the geopolitical thriller
Syriana
alongside
George Clooney
and
Jeffrey Wright
.
[72]
The film focuses on
petroleum politics
and the global influence of the oil industry. Damon says starring in the film broadened his understanding of the oil industry and that he hoped the people would talk about the film afterward.
[73]
Peter Travers
of
Rolling Stone
was mainly impressed with Clooney's acting, but also found Damon's performance "whiplash".
[74]
In 2006, Damon joined
Robert De Niro
in
The Good Shepherd
as a career
CIA
agent, and played an undercover
mobster
working for the
Massachusetts State Police
in
Martin Scorsese
's
The Departed
, a remake of the Hong Kong police thriller
Infernal Affairs
.
[22]
Assessing his work in the two films,
Manohla Dargis
of
The New York Times
wrote that Damon has the unique "ability to recede into a film while also being fully present, a recessed intensity, that distinguishes how he holds the screen."
[75]
The Departed
received critical acclaim and won the
Academy Award for Best Picture
.
[76]
[nb 4]
According to
Forbes
in August 2007, Damon was the most bankable star of the actors reviewed, his last three films at that time averaged US$29 at the box office for every dollar he earned.
[77]
Two of his major releases in 2007 were the films

[79]
Damon had an uncredited cameo in
Francis Ford Coppola
's

(2007) and another
cameo

Che Guevara
biopic
Che
.
[80]
[81]
While he was working on the
Bourne
films, Damon declined an offer from
James Cameron
to star in his upcoming film
Avatar
, as he did not want to break his
Bourne
contract. Cameron offered Damon 10% of the profits for the film, which went on to become the most successful of all time. Damon said later: "I will go down in history… you will never meet an actor who turned down more money."

[84]
His next role was Steven Soderbergh's dark comedy
The Informant!
(2009),
[85]
in which his Golden Globe-nominated work was described by

as such: "The star – who has quietly and steadily turned into a great Everyman actor – is in nimble control as he reveals his character's deep crazies."
[86]

South Africa national rugby union team
captain

in the

The money that I make for the commercials to promote them, I give 100% of that to Water.org as well. So, it's millions of dollars coming in to us."
[141]
[142]
Damon's Crypto.com commercial
[143]
started rolling out in cinemas late in 2021, and then on television in January 2022, mainly during sports programming such as NFL games. Once it was broadcast widely on television, it sparked much criticism, as did its accompanying "making of" featurette.
[144]
In
The Independent
, Nathan Place wrote, "Twitter is cringing after a TV commercial starring Matt Damon compared trading cryptocurrency to mankind's greatest achievements. In the ad, which aired during Sunday night’s NFL games, Mr Damon makes an abstract plug for crypto.com – a platform for exchanging digital currencies like Bitcoin – while striding past images of explorers and astronauts.
[145]
The New Zealand Herald
published an article by Lexie Cartwright summing up viewer reaction: "Matt Damon's new commercial plugging cryptocurrency has been absolutely savaged on social media, with viewers dubbing it 'insulting' and 'disgusting'." The story included a series of tweets, among them one by
Carole Cadwalladr
of
The Observer
in which she wrote, "There isn't enough yuck in the world to describe Matt Damon advertising a Ponzi scheme and comparing it to the moon landings."
[146]
Jody Rosen in the
New York Times
said that "There is something unseemly, to put it mildly, about the famous and fabulously wealthy urging crypto on their fans" and "The bleakness of that pitch is startling."

.
[169]
Political and social views
While discussing the
Iraq War
on
Hardball with Chris Matthews
in December 2006, Damon expressed concern about inequities across socioeconomic classes with regard to whom is tasked with the responsibility of fighting wars.
[170]
Damon is a supporter of the
Democratic Party
, and has made several critical attacks on
Republican Party
figures. However, he also expressed disappointment over the policies of President
Barack Obama
.
[171]
[172]
He had a working relationship with the
Obama administration
, primarily due to his friendship with
Jason Furman
, his former Harvard roommate who became Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisors to Obama.
[173]
In 2010, Damon narrated
Inside Job
, a documentary film about the effects of financial deregulation in the
2007–2008 financial crisis
.
[174]
In 2012, Damon joined Ben Affleck and
John Krasinski
in hosting a fundraiser for Democratic
Senate
nominee
Elizabeth Warren
.
[175]
Damon endorsed
Hillary Clinton
in the
2016 presidential election
.
[176]
[177]
In October and December 2017, Damon made headlines when he made a series of comments regarding the
Me Too movement
against sexual harassment and misconduct. On October 10,
Sharon Waxman
, a former reporter for
The New York Times
, mentioned that Damon and
Russell Crowe
had made direct phone calls to her to vouch for the head of
Miramax
Italy, Fabrizio Lombardo. In her report, she suspected Lombardo of facilitating incidents of
Harvey Weinstein
's sexual misconduct in Europe.
[178]
[179]
[180]
However, Damon clarified later that the calls were solely to reassure her of Lombardo's professional qualifications in the film industry.
[181]
Waxman endorsed Damon's statement on Twitter hours later.
[182]
Also during this time, Damon said that he had heard a story from
Ben Affleck
that
Gwyneth Paltrow
, a co-worker on a feature film of his, had been harassed by Weinstein in 1996, but thought "she had handled it" because they continued to work together, and Weinstein "treated her incredibly respectfully".
[183]
[184]
In another series of interviews during December 2017, Damon advocated for a "spectrum of behavior" analysis
[185]
[186]
[187]
[188]
of sexual misconduct cases, noting that some are more serious than others.
[189]
[187]
[188]
The comment caused offense to prominent members of the Me Too movement
[189]
[190]
and the public for being "tone-deaf in understand[ing] what abuse is like".
[190]
[189]
On January 17, 2018, Damon apologized on
The Today Show
for his social commentary, stating that he "should get in the back seat and close [his] mouth for a while".
[191]
In March 2018, Damon and Affleck announced they would adopt the
inclusion rider
agreement in all their future production deals through their company
Pearl Street Films
.
[192]
In August 2021, Damon sparked controversy after stating in an interview with
The Sunday Times
that he had only "months ago" stopped using the word "
fag
", saying that it "was commonly used when I was a kid, with a different application."
[193]
This had come after an incident in which his daughter left the table due to his usage of the word and "wrote a very long, beautiful treatise on how that word is dangerous."
[194]
He denied ever using the six-letter word "faggot" in his personal life, and, in regard to the word "fag": "I explained that that word was used constantly and casually and was even a line of dialogue in a movie of mine as recently as 2003... To my admiration and pride, she was extremely articulate about the extent to which that word would have been painful to someone in the LGBTQ+ community regardless of how culturally normalized it was. I not only agreed with her but thrilled at her passion, values and desire for social justice."
[195]

Appearing on
The Oprah Winfrey Show
on April 20, 2007, Damon promoted the organization's efforts to prevent the trees used for junk mail letters and envelopes from being chopped down. Damon stated: "For an estimated dime a day they can stop 70% of the junk mail that comes to your house. It's very simple, easy to do, great gift to give, I've actually signed up my entire family. It was a gift given to me this past holiday season and I was so impressed that I'm now on the board of the company."
