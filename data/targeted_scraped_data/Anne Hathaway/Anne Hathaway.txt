[17]
Career
2001–2004: Early roles and breakthrough
The comedy
The Princess Diaries
and the adventure drama
The Other Side of Heaven
, both 2001
Disney
films, featured Hathaway in lead roles. Based on
Meg Cabot
's
novel
, the former follows teenage
Mia Thermopolis
(Hathaway) who discovers that she is the heiress to the throne of the fictional Kingdom of Genovia. Hathaway auditioned for the role during a flight layover on the way to New Zealand.
[11]
The director
Garry Marshall
initially considered
Liv Tyler
for the role, but cast Hathaway after his granddaughters suggested that she had the best "princess" hair.
[23]
The film became a major commercial success, grossing $165 million worldwide.
[24]
Many critics lauded Hathaway's performance; a
BBC
critic noted that "Hathaway shines in the title role and generates great chemistry" and
The New York Times
'
Elvis Mitchell
found her to be "royalty in the making, a young comic talent with a scramble of features".
[25]
[26]
She earned an
MTV Movie Award for Best Breakthrough Female Performance
nomination for the role.
[27]
Hathaway starred with
Christopher Gorham
in
Mitch Davis
's
The Other Side of Heaven
. Inspired by
John H. Groberg
's memoir
In the Eye of the Storm
, the film met with mostly negative reviews and was a box-office failure.
[28]
"In terms of the princess role, there is only so long that you can play those as a young lady before you start feeling really ridiculous. They are so much fun to do, I figure I might as well get the most out of them while I can. Then [I'll] go off and play all the drug addicts and the prostitutes, and all the good ones you win Oscars for a little bit later on."
—Hathaway, 2004
[18]
Owing to the success of
The Princess Diaries
,
People
magazine named Hathaway one of its breakthrough stars of 2001.
[29]
In February 2002, Hathaway starred in the City Center Encores! concert production of
Carnival!
in her New York City stage debut; she was cast as Lili, an optimistic orphan who falls in love with a magician. Before rehearsing with the full cast, Hathaway trained with a vocal coach for two weeks. She memorized almost all her lines and songs at the first read-through.
[13]
Critics generally praised her for holding her own against well-known actors and heralded her as a new star.
[13]
In a positive review of the musical,
Charles Isherwood
of
Variety
called Hathaway the highlight of the show and "remarkably unaffected and winning", praising her convincing performance.
[30]
She won a
Clarence Derwent Award
for Most Promising Female.
[31]
Later, Hathaway voiced the audiobook release of the first three books in
The Princess Diaries
novels.
[32]
Hathaway portrayed princesses and appeared in family-oriented films over the next three years, subsequently becoming known in mainstream media as a children's role model.
[29]
After voicing Haru Yoshioka for the English version of
The Cat Returns
(2002),
[33]
she starred in
Douglas McGrath
's comedy-drama
Nicholas Nickleby
(2002), which opened to positive reviews. However, the film did not enter wide release and failed at the North American box office, totaling less than $4 million in ticket sales.
[34]
The fantasy romantic comedy
Ella Enchanted
(2004), in which Hathaway played the titular character, also performed poorly at the box office.
[35]
She had first read
the book on which the film is based
when she was 16, and stated that the script was originally much closer to the source material but did not work as a film, and therefore preferred the picture the way it turned out.
[18]
It opened to mostly mixed reviews.
[36]
Hathaway sang three songs on the
film's soundtrack
, including a duet with singer
Jesse McCartney
.
[37]
In 2003, Hathaway turned down the role of Christine Daaé for
Joel Schumacher
's
The Phantom of the Opera
(2004), because the production schedule of the film overlapped with
The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement
(2004).
[31]
She was initially hesitant and nervous about starring in the sequel, but agreed to it after Marshall convinced her that she was not repeating anything.
[18]
The film was released in August 2004 to negative reviews,
[38]
but made $95.1 million against a $40 million budget.
[39]
2005–2008: Transition to adult roles and critical recognition
Hathaway began taking on adult roles to avoid
typecasting
,
[29]
remarking that "anybody who was a role model for children needs a reprieve", but noted that "it's lovely to think that my audience is growing up with me".
[40]
After replacing
Tara Strong
for the voice role of
Red Puckett
in
Hoodwinked!
,
[41]
she starred in the drama
Havoc
(2005) as a spoiled socialite, appearing nude in some of its scenes. While the film was thematically different from her previous releases, Hathaway denied that her role was an attempt to be seen as a more mature actress, citing her belief that performing nudity in certain films is merely a part of what her chosen form of art demands of her; because of this belief she does not consider appearing nude in appropriate films to be morally objectionable.
[42]
The film was not released in theaters in the United States due to unfavorable critical reception.
[43]
In the 2005 drama
Brokeback Mountain
, which depicts the emotional and sexual relationship between two men married to women,
Ennis Del Mar
(played by
Heath Ledger
) and
Jack Twist
(played by
Jake Gyllenhaal
), Hathaway played Lureen, the wife of Jack. The actress was originally sent the script with the part of Ennis' wife in mind, but decided to audition for Lureen instead after she read it.
[44]
She lied during the audition about her knowledge of riding so that the director
Ang Lee
would cast her, but did subsequently take lessons.
[45]
The film received critical acclaim and several
Academy Award
nominations.
[46]
Peter Travers
of
Rolling Stone
wrote that Hathaway "excels at showing Lureen's journey from cutie-pie to hard case", and
Todd McCarthy
of
Variety
credited her for "provid[ing] an entertaining contrast in wifely disappointment".
[47]
[48]
Hathaway stated that the content of
Brokeback Mountain
was more important than its award count, and that making the film made her more aware of the kind of stories she wanted to tell as an actor.
[49]
At this point, she realized that she wanted to play roles to move audiences or otherwise entertain them so much that they forget about their own lives.
[5]
Hathaway at the 2007
Deauville American Film Festival
Hathaway starred in the comedy-drama
The Devil Wears Prada
(2006), based on
Lauren Weisberger
's
novel of the same name
, as a college graduate who becomes an assistant to a powerful
fashion magazine editor
(played by
Meryl Streep
).
[7]
She was "the ninth choice" for the part, citing this later as an inspiration for people to never give up,
[50]
and in preparation she volunteered for a few weeks as an assistant at an
auction house
.
[51]
She also followed a weight-loss regimen, along with co-star
Emily Blunt
, which made them hungry and led to crying.
[52]
Hathaway stated that working on the film made her respect the fashion industry a great deal more than she did previously, though she admitted that her personal style was something she "still can't get right".
[15]
The Devil Wears Prada
received positive reviews;
Roger Ebert
called Hathaway "a great beauty [...] who makes a convincing career girl" and
Rotten Tomatoes
found "Streep in top form and Anne Hathaway more than holding her own".
[53]
[54]
It proved to be her most widely seen film to that point, with a worldwide gross of over $326.5 million.
[55]
Originally cast in
Knocked Up
, Hathaway dropped out before production and was replaced with
Katherine Heigl
. This happened because, according to writer-director
Judd Apatow
, the actress was uncomfortable with the use of real footage of a woman in labor;
[56]
she believed it did not contribute to the film's story.
[57]
Her sole release in 2007 was the biographical romantic drama
Becoming Jane
, as the titular English author
Jane Austen
.
[49]
A fan of Austen since age 14, Hathaway prepared for the role by rereading Austen's books and conducting historical research, such as perusing the author's letters; she also learned
sign language
,
calligraphy
, dance choreography, and the piano. She moved to England a month before filming to improve her English accent.

[40]
While filming an action sequence, she split the flesh of her shin to the bone, which led to her receiving 15 stitches.
[5]
The film, centering on an analyst who dreams of becoming a real field agent and a better spy, was a financial success.
[63]
Hathaway's two other releases of 2008 were the drama
Rachel Getting Married
and the mystery thriller
Passengers
, the latter of which was a critical and commercial failure.
[64]
In
Jonathan Demme
's
Rachel Getting Married
, she starred as a young woman who, after being released from drug rehabilitation, returns home for her sister's wedding. Portraying a character she described as "narcissistic—downright selfish," Hathaway garnered critical acclaim for her performance.
[65]
Peter Travers found her to be "raw and riveting" in the role, adding that she "acts the hell out of it, achieving a state of sorrowful grace".
[66]
She received
Academy Award
and
Golden Globe Award
nominations for Best Actress.
[65]
[67]
2009–2011: Romantic comedies and hosting events
Hathaway starred in
Bride Wars
(2009), which she described as "hideously commercial—gloriously so".
[68]
The romantic comedy, in which she and
Kate Hudson
played two best friends who become rivals after their weddings are scheduled on the same day, was a critical failure; it was named among the ten worst
chick flicks
in history by
Time
in 2010.
[69]

MTV Movie Award for Best Female Performance
nomination.
[70]
[71]

, directed by Garry Marshall. The film was a commercial success, grossing more than $215 million worldwide against a budget of $52 million.
[77]
Hathaway played the
White Queen
in
Tim Burton
's
2010 adaptation
of the fantasy novels
Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
and
Through the Looking-Glass
alongside
Helena Bonham Carter
and
Johnny Depp
. She summed up her character with a caption on a magnet of
Happy Bunny
holding a knife; "Cute but psycho. Things even out."
[78]
Hathaway described her interpretation of the White Queen as "a
punk-rock
vegan
pacifist
", drawing inspiration from
Debbie Harry
and the artwork of
Dan Flavin
.
[79]
Alice in Wonderland
received mixed reviews from critics, who praised the film's visuals but criticized the lack of narrative coherence.
[80]
Commercially, it grossed $1 billion to become the

[81]
Hathaway at the
Nobel Peace Prize Concert
in 2010, which she hosted with actor
Denzel Washington
Hathaway reunited with Jake Gyllenhaal as a free-spirited artist with
Parkinson's disease
in
Edward Zwick
's erotic romantic comedy-drama
Love & Other Drugs
, based on the nonfiction book
Hard Sell: The Evolution of a Viagra Salesman
by
Jamie Reidy
. For the role, she spent time with a Parkinson's patient to research the disease, and in preparation for its nude scenes, she watched films of
Kate Winslet
and
Penélope Cruz
who, in Hathaway's view, had performed nudity with sensitivity and dignity.
[82]
[83]
She believed these scenes would not discourage socially conservative people from watching the film.
[84]
Critics generally praised the film's adult romance, but were unenthusiastic about its plot elements.
[85]
Hathaway's performance, which Ebert called "warm, lovable",
[86]
earned her a
Satellite Award
and a nomination for the
Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Comedy or Musical
.
[87]
[88]
Together with actor
Denzel Washington
, Hathaway hosted the
Nobel Peace Prize Concert
in Oslo, Norway in December 2010.
[89]
Two months later, she and
James Franco
hosted the
83rd Academy Awards
.

Critics were unenthusiastic about their chemistry, but thought Hathaway gave her best and did a better job than Franco, who they felt seemed uninterested.
[91]
At the
63rd Primetime Emmy Awards
, she garnered an
Outstanding Variety Special (Live)
nomination.
[92]
In 2011, Hathaway voiced Jewel, a female
Spix's macaw
from Rio de Janeiro, in the animated film
Rio
, produced by
20th Century Fox
and
Blue Sky Studios
. It received generally positive reviews from film critics, who praised the visuals, voice acting and music.
[93]
A commercial success, it grossed more than $484 million worldwide against a budget of $90 million.
[94]
Later, Hathaway starred alongside
Jim Sturgess
in
Lone Scherfig
's
One Day
, based on
David Nicholls
'
novel of the same name
. The film tells the story of two young people who meet annually for twenty years after they shared a platonic one-night stand together. Hathaway was clandestinely given the script, as
One Day
was set in Britain, and Scherfig was not looking for any American actresses for the part. After a nonproductive meeting with Scherfig, Hathaway left a list of songs for the director, who after listening to them, cast the actress for the part.
[b]
[95]
Hathaway later expressed regret that she might have unwittingly held
misogyny
during production, as she came to feel that she had not trusted Scherfig as a director because of her gender.
[96]
Her
Yorkshire accent
in the film was considered subpar. Columnist Suzanne Moore, reviewing the film on
BBC Radio 4
's
Front Row
, said Hathaway's accents were "all over the shop", adding, "Sometimes she's from Scotland, sometimes she's from New York, you just can't tell".
[97]
The film itself received polarizing reviews from critics,
[98]
but became a moderate box office success.
[99]
[100]
2012–2014:
Les Misérables
and films with Christopher Nolan
In 2012, Hathaway's audiobook recording of
L. Frank Baum
's 1900 novel
The Wonderful Wizard of Oz
was released at
Audible.com
and garnered her an
Audie Award
nomination for Best Solo Narration – Female.
[101]
She then played the sly, morally ambiguous cat burglar
Selina Kyle / Catwoman
in
The Dark Knight Rises
, the final installment in
Christopher Nolan
's
The Dark Knight
trilogy
.
[102]
Hathaway auditioned not knowing what part she was being considered for, admitting that she had
Harley Quinn
in mind but only learned her role after talking with Nolan for an hour.
[103]
She described it as her most physically demanding assignment to that point, as she had to redouble her efforts in the gym to keep up with the requirements of the role.
[104]
[105]
She trained extensively in martial arts, and looked to
Hedy Lamarr
in developing her performance as Catwoman.
[106]
The Dark Knight Rises
was critically successful and grossed more than $1 billion worldwide, becoming the
third-highest-grossing film of 2012
.
[107]
IGN
reviewer Jim Vejvoda labeled Hathaway "a magnetic presence whenever she's onscreen" and added, "Selina may be the proverbial good bad girl, the thief with a heart of gold, but Hathaway imbues her with a wounded spirit and a survivor's edge that makes her feel genuine and sympathetic even when she's being naughty."
[108]
She won the
Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actress
for her performance.
[109]
Hathaway portrayed
Fantine
, a prostitute dying of
tuberculosis
, in
Tom Hooper
's
Les Misérables
, an adaptation of the
stage musical of the same name
. Footage of the actress singing "
I Dreamed a Dream
", a song from the film, was shown at the 2012
CinemaCon
, where Hooper described her singing as "raw" and "real".
[110]
In preparation for the role, Hathaway consumed fewer than 500 calories a day to lose 25 pounds (11 kg), researched prostitution, and cut her hair.
[111]
[112]
To adopt her character's mental space alone during production in London, she sent her husband back to the United States; this resulted in her becoming increasingly temperamental.
[113]
Ann Hornaday
of
The Washington Post
asserted that "the centerpiece of a movie composed entirely of centerpieces belongs to Anne Hathaway, who as the tragic heroine Fantine sings another of the memorable numbers".
[114]
She won the
Academy Award
,
Golden Globe
,
Screen Actors Guild
and
BAFTA Award
for Best Supporting Actress.
[115]
[116]
Asked if she was pleased with her performance in the film, Hathaway expressed doubts, replying with "Eh".
[115]
In January 2013, Hathaway's rendition of "I Dreamed a Dream" reached number 69 on the
Billboard
Hot 100
.
[117]
Hathaway at a screening of
Rio 2
in 2014
After briefly appearing in the romantic comedy
Don Jon
(2013),
[118]
Hathaway starred in and co-produced (with her husband and others)
Song One
. In the drama film, she played an anthropology student who returns home to see her injured brother, Henry (played by
Ben Rosenfield
), and soon begins a romantic relationship with his favorite musician, James Forester (played by
Johnny Flynn
). Her character was originally written as a 19-year-old, but Kate Barker-Froyland, the film's writer and director, changed the part to that of an older woman after casting Hathaway.
[119]
The actress said the reason she decided to produce the film was because of its depiction of the healing power of music and second chances.
[120]
For the film's soundtrack, she provided her voice for the song "Afraid of Heights".
[121]
Song One
premiered in the U.S. Dramatic Competition at the
30th Sundance Film Festival
in January 2014,
[122]
and released in theaters the following year to mixed reviews from critics.
[123]
Commercially, the film failed to recoup its $6 million investment.
[124]
Hathaway reprised her role as Jewel in the animated film
Rio 2
—her third film with
Jamie Foxx
—which was released in 2014.
[125]
It grossed nearly five times more than its $103 million budget.
[126]
Her sole live-action release of 2014 was Christopher Nolan's epic science fiction film
Interstellar
. Set in a dystopian future where humanity is struggling to survive, it follows a crew of astronauts who travel through a wormhole in search of a new home for mankind. Hathaway was drawn to the part of
NASA
scientist Amelia Brand due to the character's growth from an arrogant to a humbler person.
[127]
With a budget of $165 million, the high-profile production co-starring
Matthew McConaughey
was filmed mostly using
IMAX
cameras.
[128]

Hathaway nearly experienced hypothermia while filming a water scene in Iceland, as the
dry suit
she was wearing had not been properly secured.
[130]
Reviewers for
The Independent
and
Empire
found her to be "affecting" in the part of a scientist unable to decide between her personal feelings and professional responsibilities,
[131]
and took notice of the "soulful nuance" in her performance.
[132]
Interstellar
grossed over $701 million worldwide,
[133]
and earned Hathaway a nomination for the
Saturn Award for Best Actress
.
[134]

magazine wrote, "
The Intern
gets off on De Niro's amiability and Hathaway's sweet energy".
[138]
[139]
The film grossed $194 million worldwide against a $35 million budget.
[140]
The 2015
found footage
horror film
Be My Cat: A Film for Anne
, about an aspiring Romanian filmmaker who goes to shocking extremes to convince Hathaway to star in his film, was officially selected and had its North American premiere at the 2016
Nashville Film Festival
.
[141]
Hathaway at the
2016 Toronto International Film Festival
Hathaway reprised the role of the White Queen in
Alice Through the Looking Glass
, the 2016 sequel to
Alice in Wonderland
.
[142]
That March, it was reported that she would reprise her role for
The Princess Diaries 3
; the project was shelved after the death of
Garry Marshall
, who was set to direct the film.
[143]
Hathaway is one of several actors featured on
Barbra Streisand
's 2016 album
Encore: Movie Partners Sing Broadway
. Along with
Daisy Ridley
, Hathaway and Streisand performed the song "
At The Ballet
" from
A Chorus Line
; she played the role of Maggie, one of a trio of dancers hoping to be cast in an upcoming show.
[144]
Her final film that year was alongside
Jason Sudeikis
in
Nacho Vigalondo
's science fiction black comedy
Colossal
(2016).
[145]
Playing an unemployed young writer, Hathaway was the first actress to sign on at a time when the project had no financial backing. She was drawn to the genre-hopping nature of the script, later comparing it to
Being John Malkovich
(1999), one of her favorite films.
[146]
The film received positive reviews from critics, but earned only $4 million at the box office.
[147]
[148]
After a two-year absence from the screen, Hathaway starred as a famous actress in
Ocean's 8
, an all-female spin-off of the
Ocean's Eleven
franchise
from director
Gary Ross
.
[149]
Co-starring
Sandra Bullock
and
Cate Blanchett
, it follows a group of criminals who plan to rob the
Met Gala
. Hathaway was drawn to the idea of playing someone with an immense ego and saw the part as an opportunity "to lean into all the ridiculous fame nonsense that I've been trying to side-step for all of these years."
[150]
She hoped the film would be profitable so that it could debunk claims that female-led films do not succeed commercially.
[151]
Critics generally considered Hathaway to be a scene-stealer among the cast,
[152]
with
ABC Online
's Jason Di Rosso writing, "The film's best moments belong to Hathaway as the anxiety-ridden, vain and capricious starlet. She's the only successful meld of comedy and pathos—a victim of the celebrity treadmill who is also capable of outsmarting it."
[153]
Ocean's 8
was a box office success, grossing over $297 million worldwide against a $70 million budget.
[154]
Hathaway's first two films of 2019—the thriller
Serenity
and the comedy
The Hustle
—were poorly received by critics.
[155]
[156]
In the former, she starred alongside her
Interstellar
costar
Matthew McConaughey
as a woman who tasks her ex-husband to kill her new abusive husband, a role for which she dyed her hair blonde.
[157]
The Washington Post
dismissed her performance as "cartoonish", adding that her
femme fatale
character was reminiscent of "a kind of live-action
Jessica Rabbit
".
[158]
The latter film was a remake of the 1988 film
Dirty Rotten Scoundrels
, co-starring
Rebel Wilson
, which emerged as a
sleeper hit
.

Hathaway began the new decade with the political thriller
The Last Thing He Wanted
(2020), based on the
book of the same name
by
Joan Didion
. She considered herself to be an unlikely choice for the part of a headstrong journalist, as it differed from her own "puppy dog" personality.
[164]
It received negative reviews from critics.
[165]
She then starred in
The Witches
, an adaptation of the
novel of the same name
from director
Robert Zemeckis
, in which she played an
evil witch
. The film received mixed reviews from critics, who deemed it inferior to the
1990 adaptation
.
[166]
[167]
Hathaway's performances in both films earned her nominations for Worst Actress at the
41st Golden Raspberry Awards

[173]
[174]
It received favorable reviews, with particular praise for Hathaway's portrayal of
Rebekah Neumann
.
[175]
Angie Han of
The Hollywood Reporter
commended her for resisting "the temptation to turn Rebekah into an exaggerated caricature of an entitled woo-woo type, which ultimately only makes Rebekah funnier".
[176]
Hathaway starred in
James Gray
's semi-autobiographical period drama
Armageddon Time
, portraying a character inspired by Gray's mother.
[177]
David Rooney of
The Hollywood Reporter
considered it her best performance since

, while
Owen Gleiberman
of
Variety
praised Hathaway for making her character "at once affectionate and blinkered".
[178]
[179]

[185]
A remake of the
2018 Belgian film
, she co-starred with
Jessica Chastain
.
[186]
Hathaway created a "protective layer" between herself and her character, requesting for cast and crew members to refer to her by her character’s name as she deemed the loss of a child her "worst fear".
[187]
Writing for
The Guardian
,
Peter Bradshaw
thought that her performance was overshadowed by that of Chastain.
[188]
She next led the romantic comedy
The Idea of You
, based on
Robinne Lee
's novel of the same name, playing a divorced mother who begins a romance with a younger pop star.
[189]

Nicholas Galitzine
.
[191]

Public image
Hathaway signing autographs for fans at the
2008 Toronto International Film Festival
Describing her off-screen persona, John Hiscock of
The Daily Telegraph
wrote in 2014 that Hathaway is a "well-grounded, friendly young woman with a good sense of humour, a wide smile and an easy-going attitude".
[194]
Hiscock further opines that, despite considerable success, she has never "gone Hollywood", remaining close with her friends.
[194]
The authors of the book
365 Style

[197]
After her 2013 awards acceptance speeches for

[198]
Discussing this, Hathaway explained that she feels anxious when public speaking but has since grown from it and become a more compassionate person.
[197]
She said regarding her perceived image: "People have this idea of me as just being a very prim, professional girl, which I suppose I am, but I do cut loose and have fun in my life".
[5]
Remarking upon her performance in
Twelfth Night
, Charles Isherwood wrote, "on screen or onstage Ms. Hathaway possesses the unmistakable glow of a natural star".

writer wrote that many of her good performances have been overlooked, describing her career as "subtle brilliance that has largely gone unnoticed".
[199]
Discussing her career in 2015, Hathaway said that after her breakthrough in
The Princess Diaries
, she struggled to find serious roles or ones that were not about princesses. According to Judi Gugliemli of

[200]
A writer for
