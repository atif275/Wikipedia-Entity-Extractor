Early life
[
edit
]
Sean Gordon Murphy was born in
Nashua, New Hampshire
in late 1980. He showed an interest in comics during grade school. In
Salem
he apprenticed to local painter and cartoonist, Leslie Swank. He graduated from
Pinkerton Academy
in 1999, and attended
Massachusetts College of Art
in Boston, and then
Savannah College of Art and Design
.

Career
[
edit
]
Murphy started working professionally before graduating, on titles such
Star Wars
and
Noble Causes
, before moving onto various projects for
Dark Horse Comics
.
[1]
Murphy's comic book work includes the miniseries
Batman/Scarecrow: Year One
with writer
Bruce Jones
for
DC Comics
and the graphic novel
Off Road
for
Oni Press
.
He has also had a run on
Hellblazer
[2]
and, also at
Vertigo
, he is the artist on
Joe the Barbarian
, with writer
Grant Morrison
.
[3]
In 2005 he published his first original graphic novel,
Off Road
, which went on to win an American Library Association Award for young adults.
[1]
In 2006 Murphy illustrated the Dark Horse miniseries
Outer Orbit
along with miniseries co-creator, Zach Howard.
[4]
Murphy worked on
Joe the Barbarian
, which was published in early 2010.
In 2012 Murphy wrote, penciled and inked the six-issue, black and white creator-owned Vertigo miniseries
Punk Rock Jesus
, whose protagonist is a clone of
Jesus Christ
who starred in his own
reality television
program as a child, and has grown into a rebellious young man.

The miniseries was described as Murphy's "passion project years in the making", and focuses on religion and the media in the United States as themes, more complicated issues than Murphy had previously addressed in his work. The series was inspired by Murphy's reaction to ascendance of
Sarah Palin
into the national spotlight. Murphy says, "Sarah Palin scared the shit out of me in 2007 -- I was floored that someone that ignorant could come so close to being President. And a lot of her comments were about religion, politics, and the media. It made me want to take action, but I was just a comic book artist and I wasn't sure what I could do. So I started addressing my concerns about these three topics in
Punk Rock Jesus
. And I felt I really had something, but then
Obama
was elected and suddenly the need for
Punk Rock Jesus
was gone. I was an Obama fan, and I'm glad that Palin isn't anywhere near the nuclear codes, but I felt that I'd missed a window where
Punk Rock Jesus
would be most relevant. But [the
2012 election
] has brought up all my old concerns, so suddenly
Punk Rock Jesus
feels relevant again."
[7]
The series received positive reviews by
Comic Book Resources
,
[5]
[8]
Weekly Comic Book Review
,
[9]
Bleeding Cool
[10]
and
IGN
.
[11]

Murphy lives in
Portland, Maine
with his wife Katana Collins, having moved there from Brooklyn in 2016.
[12]
[13]
Murphy was raised a
Catholic
